Black Eyes

Black eyes open wide
It’s time to testify
There’s no room for lies
And everyone’s waitin' for you

And I'm gone sittin' by the phone and I'm all alone by the wayside
And I'm gone sittin' by the phone and I'm all alone by the wayside

By the wayside
I'm by the wayside
I'm by the wayside

Too far gone and I'm by the phone
And I'm all alone and I'm awful lonely by the wayside

I'm by the wayside
I'm by the wayside
I'm by the wayside

By the wayside
By the wayside
By the wayside

I'm by the wayside
By the wayside
By the wayside

Black eyes open wide
It’s time to testify
There’s no room for lies
And everyone’s waitin' for you
Everyone's lookin' at you
Everyone's lookin' at you
Everyone’s waiting for you
Everyone’s waiting for you
Ooooooooooooo

Shallow

Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

In the sha-ha, sha-la-low
In the sha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now

Hoo, huh, uh, huhh-ow
Huh, huhh-huhhh

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now
In the sha-ha, sha-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now

Don’t Answer Me

If you believe in the power of magic,
I can change your mind
And if you need to believe in someone,
Turn and look behind
When we were living in a dream world,
Clouds got in the way
We gave it up in a moment of madness
And threw it all away

Don't answer me, don't break the silence
Don't let me win
Don't answer me, stay on your island
Don't let me in

Run away and hide from everyone
Can you change the things we've said and done?

If you believe in the power of magic,
It's all a fantasy
So if you need to believe in someone
Just pretend it's me
It ain't enough that we meet as strangers
I can't set you free
So will you turn your back forever on
What you mean to me?

Don't answer me, don't break the silence
Don't let me win
Don't answer me, stay on your island
Don't let me in

Runaway and hide from everyone
Can you change the things we've said and done?

Eye in the Sky

Don't think sorry's easily said
Don't try turning tables instead
You've taken lots of Chances before
But I ain't gonna give anymore
Don't ask me
That's how it goes
Cause part of me knows what you're thinkin'

Don't say words you're gonna regret
Don't let the fire rush to your head
I've heard the accusation before
And I ain't gonna take any more
Believe me
The sun in your Eyes
Made some of the lies worth believing

Chorus:
I am the eye in the sky
Looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules
Dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see any more
To know that
I can read your mind, I can read your mind

Don't leave false illusions behind
Don't Cry cause I ain't changing my mind
So find another fool like before
Cause I ain't gonna live anymore believing
Some of the lies while all of the Signs are deceiving

I Wouldn’t Want to Be Like You
If I had a mind to
I wouldn't want to think like you
And if I had time to
I wouldn't want to talk to you

I don't care
What you do
I wouldn't want to be like you

If I was high class
I wouldn't need a buck to pass
And if I was a fall guy
I wouldn't need no alibi

I don't care
What you do
I wouldn't want to be like you

Back on the bottom line
Diggin' for a lousy dime
If I hit a mother lode
I'd cover anything that showed

I don't care
What you do
I wouldn't want to be like you

21st Century Schizoid Man

Cat's foot iron claw
Neuro-surgeons scream for more
At paranoia's poison door
Twenty first century schizoid man
 
Blood rack barbed wire
Politicians' funeral pyre
Innocents raped with napalm fire
Twenty first century schizoid man
 
Death seed blind man's greed
Poets' starving children bleed
Nothing he's got he really needs
Twenty first century schizoid man

Book of Saturday

If I only could deceive you
Forgetting the game
Every time I try to leave you
You laugh just the same
'Cause my wheels never touch the road
And the jumble of lies we told
Just returns to my back to weigh me down
We lay cards upon the table
The backs of our hands
And I swear I like your people
The boys in the band
Reminiscences gone astray
Coming back to enjoy the fray
In a tangle of night and daylight sounds
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo
All completeness in the morning
Asleep on your side
I'll be waking up the crewmen
Banana-boat ride
She responds like limousine
Brought alive on the silent screen
To the shuddering breath of yesterday
There's the succor of the needy
Incredible scenes
I'll believe you in the future
Your life and death dreams
As the cavalry of despair
Takes a stand in the lady's hair
For the favor of making sweet sixteen
You make my life and times
A book of bluesy Saturdays
And I have to choose

Dinosaur

Long ago and far away in a different age
when I was a dumb young guy
fossilized photos of my life then
illustrate what an easy prey I must have been
standing in the sun, idiot savant
something like a monument
I'm a dinosaur, somebody is digging my bones
 
Ignorance has alway been something I excel in
followed by naivete and pride
doesn't take a scientist to see how
any clever predator could have a piece of me
standing in the sun, idiot savant
something like a monument
I'm a dinosaur, somebody is digging my bones
 
When I look back on the past
it's a wonder I'm not yet extinct
all the mistakes and bad judgements I made
nearly pushed me to the brink
it doesn't pay to be too nice
it's the one thing I have learned
still, I made my fossil bed
now I toss and turn
 
I'm a dinosaur, somebody is digging my bones

Epitaph

The wall on which the prophets wrote
is cracking at the seams.
Upon the instruments of death
the sunlight brightly gleams.
When every man is torn apart
with nightmares and with dream
will no one lay the laurel wreath
when silence drowns the screams?
 
Confusion will be my epitaph
as I crawl a cracked and broken path.
If we make it, we can all sit back and laugh
but, I fear, tomorrow I'll be crying.
Yes, I fear, tomorrow I'll be crying.
Yes, I fear, tomorrow I'll be crying.
 
Between the iron gates of fate
the seeds of time were sown
and, watered by the deeds of those
who know and who are known,
knowledge is a deadly friend
when no one sets the rules.
The fate of all mankind I see
is in the hands of fools.
 
The wall on which the prophets wrote
is cracking at the seams.
Upon the instruments of death
the sunlight brightly gleams.
When every man is torn apart
with nightmares and with dreams
will no one lay the laurel wreath
when silence drowns the screams?
 
Confusion will be my epitaph
as I crawl a cracked and broken path.
If we make it, we can all sit back and laugh
but, I fear, tomorrow I'll be crying.
Yes, I fear, tomorrow I'll be crying.
Yes, I fear, tomorrow I'll be crying.
 
Crying, crying.
Yes, I fear, tomorrow I'll be crying.
Yes, I fear, tomorrow I'll be crying.
Yes, I fear, tomorrow I'll be crying.
Crying.

I Talk to the Wind

Said the straight man to the late man
Where have you been
I've been here and I've been there
And I've been in between.
 
I talk to the wind
My words are all carried away
I talk to the wind
The wind does not hear
The wind cannot hear.
 
I'm on the outside looking inside
What do I see
Much confusion
Disillusion
All around me.
 
You don't possess me
Don't impress me
Just upset my mind
Can't instruct me or conduct me
Just use up my time
 
I talk to the wind
My words are all carried away
I talk to the wind
The wind does not hear
The wind cannot hear.

In The Wake Of Poseidon

Plato's spawn cold ivied eyes
Snare truth in bone and globe.
Harlequins coin pointless games
Sneer jokes in parrot's robe.
Two women weep, Dame Scarlet Screen
Sheds sudden theatre rain,
Whilst dark in dream the Midnight Queen
Knows every human pain.
 
In air, fire, earth and water
World on the scales.
Air, fire, earth and water
Balance of change
World on the scales
On the scales.
 
Bishop's kings spin judgement's blade
Scratch "Faith" on nameless graves.
Harvest hags Hoard ash and sand
Rack rope and chain for slaves
Who fireside fear fermented words
Then rear to spoil the feast;
Whilst in the aisle the mad man smiles
To him it matters least.
 
Heroes hands drain stones for blood
To whet the scaling knife.
Magi blind with visions light
Net death in dread of life.
Their children kneel in Jesus till
They learn the price of nail;
Whilst all around our mother earth
Waits balanced on the scales.

Moonchild

Call her moonchild
Dancing in the shallows of a river
Lonely moonchild
Dreaming in the shadow
of the willow
 
Talking to the trees of the
cobweb strange
Sleeping on the steps of a fountain
Waving silver wands to the
night-birds song
Waiting for the sun on the mountain
 
She's a moonchild
Gathering the flowers in a garden.
Lonely moonchild
Drifting on the echoes of the hours
 
Sailing on the wind
in a milk white gown
Dropping circle stones on a sun dial
Playing hide and seek
with the ghosts of dawn
Waiting for a smile from a sun child


The Court of the Crimson King

The rusted chains of prison moons
Are shattered by the sun.
I walk a road, horizons change
The tournament's begun.
The purple piper plays his tune,
The choirs softly sing;
Three lullabies in an ancient tongue,
For the court of the crimson king.
 
The keeper of the city keys
Put shutters on the dreams.
I wait outside the pilgrim's door
With insufficient schemes.
The black queen chants
the funeral march,
The cracked brass bells will ring;
To summon back the fire witch
To the court of the crimson king.
 
The gardener plants an evergreen
Whilst trampling on a flower.
I chase the wind of a prism ship
To taste the sweet and sour.
The pattern juggler lifts his hand;
The orchestra begin.
As slowly turns the grinding wheel
In the court of the crimson king.
 
On soft gray mornings widows cry
The wise men share a joke;
I run to grasp divining signs
To satisfy the hoax.
The yellow jester does not play
But gently pulls the strings
And smiles as the puppets dance
In the court of the crimson king.

People are People

People are people, so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully?
People are people, so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully?

So we're different colours and we're different creeds
And different people have different needs
It's obvious you hate me, though I've done nothing wrong
I've never even met you, so what could I have done?
I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand
People are people, so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully?
People are people, so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully?

Now you're punching and you're kicking and you're shouting at me
I'm relying on your common decency
So far it hasn't surfaced, but I'm sure it exists
It just takes a while to travel from your head to your fists

I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand

People are people, so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully?
People are people, so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully?

I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand
I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand
I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand
I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand
I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand
I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand

Enjoy the Silence

Words like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand?
Oh, my little girl

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Enjoy the silence

Personal Jesus

Reach out and touch faith

Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who's there

Feeling unknown and you're all alone
Flesh and bone by the telephone
Lift up the receiver, I'll make you a believer
Take second best, put me to the test
Things on your chest you need to confess
I will deliver, you know I'm a forgiver

Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith

Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who's there


Feeling unknown and you're all alone
Flesh and bone by the telephone
Lift up the receiver, I'll make you a believer
I will deliver, you know I'm a forgiver

Reach out and touch faith
Your own personal Jesus
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith

Wheres the Revolution

You've been kept down
You've been pushed 'round
You've been lied to
You've been fed truths
Who's making your decisions?
You or your religion
Your government, your countries
You patriotic junkies

Where's the revolution?
Come on, people
You're letting me down
Where's the revolution?
Come on, people
You're letting me down

You've been pissed on
For too long
Your rights abused
Your views refused
They manipulate and threaten
With terror as a weapon
Scare you till you're stupefied
Wear you down until you're on their side

Where's the revolution?
Come on, people
You're letting me down
Where's the revolution?
Come on, people
You're letting me down

The train is coming
The train is coming
The train is coming
The train is coming
So get on board
Get on board
Get on board
Get on board
The engine's humming
The engine's humming
The engine's humming
The engine's humming
So get on board
Get on board
Get on board
Get on board

The train is coming
The train is coming
The train is coming
The train is coming
So get on board
Get on board
Get on board

The engine's humming

Cover Me

I've felt better
I've been up all night
I can feel it coming
The morning light
The air is so cold here
It's so hard to breathe
We better take cover
Will you cover me?

Way up here with the Northern lights
Beyond you and me
I dreamt of us in another life
One we've never reached

You know we're sinking
We could fade away
I'm not going down
Not today
The air is so cold here
Too cold to see
We have to take cover
Cover me

Way up here with the Northern lights
Beyond these broken bars
I pictured us in another life
Where we're all super stars

Policy of Truth

You had something to hide
Should have hidden it, shouldn't you?
Now you're not satisfied
With what you're being put through

It's just time to pay the price
For not listening to advice
And deciding in your youth
On the policy of truth

Things could be so different now
It used to be so civilised
You will always wonder how
It could have been if you'd only lied

It's too late to change events
It's time to face the consequence
For delivering the proof
In the policy of truth

Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before

Now you're standing there tongue-tied
You'd better learn your lesson well
Hide what you have to hide
And tell what you have to tell

You'll see your problems multiplied
If you continually decide
To faithfully pursue
The policy of truth

Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before

The Great Gates of Kiev

Come forth, from love's spire
Born in life's fire,
Born in life's fire.
Come forth, from love's spire
In the burning, all are +AFs-of our+AF0- yearning,
for life to be.
And in pain there will +AFs-must+AF0- be gain,
New Life+ACE-
Stirring in, salty streams
And dark hidden seams
Where the fossil sun gleams.
They were, sent from +AFs-to+AF0- the gates
Ride the tides of fate
Ride the tides of fate.
They were, sent from +AFs-to+AF0- the gates,

There's no end to my life,
No beginning to my death:

The Stones Of Years
Has the dawn ever seen your eyes?
Have the days made you so unwise?
Realize, you are.
Had you talked to the winds of time,
Then you'd know how the waters rhyme,
Taste of wine,
How can you know where you've been?
In time you'll see the sign
And realize your sin.
Will you know how the seed is sown?
All your time has been overgrown,
Never known.
Have you walked on the stones of years?
When you speak, is it you that hears?
Are your ears full?
You can't hear anything at all.
Mass
The preacher said a prayer.
Save ev'ry single hair on his head.
He's dead.
The minister of hate had just arrived to be spared.
Who cared?
The weaver in the web that he made+ACE-
The pilgrim wandered in,
Commiting ev'ry sin that he could
So good...
The cardinal of grief was set in his belief he'd saved
From the grave
The weaver in the web that he made+ACE-
The high priest took a blade
To bless the ones that prayed,
And all obeyed.
The messenger of fear is slowly growing, nearer to the time,
A sign.
The weaver in the web that he made+ACE-
A bishops rings a bell,
A cloak of darkness fell across the ground
Without a sound+ACE-
The silent choir sing and in their silence,
Bring jaded sound, harmonic ground.
The weaver in the web that he made+ACE-
The Battlefield
Clear the battlefield and let me see
All the profit from our victory.
You talk of freedom, starving children poor.
Are you deaf when you hear the season's call?
Were you there to watch the earth be scorched?
Did you stand beside the spectral torch?
Know the leaves of sorrow turned their face,
Scattered on the ashes of disgrace.
Ev'ry blade is sharp+ADs- the arrows fly
Where the victims of your armies lie,
Where the blades of brass and arrows reign
Then there will be very little sorrow,
Very little pain.

Lucky Man
He had white horses
And ladies by the score
All dressed in satin
And waiting by the door

Ooooh, what a lucky man he was
Ooooh, what a lucky man he was

White lace and feathers
They made up his bed
A gold covered mattress
On which he was laid

Ooooh, what a lucky man he was
Ooooh, what a lucky man he was

He went to fight wars
For his country and his king
Of his honor and his glory
The people would sing

Ooooh, what a lucky man he was
Ooooh, what a lucky man he was

A bullet had found him
His blood ran as he cried
No money could save him
So he laid down and he died

Ooooh, what a lucky man he was
Ooooh, what a lucky man he was

The Endless Enigma

Why do you stare
Do you think that I care?
You've been mislead
By the thoughts in your head

Your words waste and decay
Nothing you say
Reaches my ears anyway
You never spoke a word of truth

Why do you think
I believe what you said
Few of your words
Ever enter my head

I'm tired of hypocrite freaks
With tongues in their cheeks
Turning their eyes as they speak
They make me sick and tired

Are you confused
To the point in your mind
Though you're blind
Can't you see you're wrong
Won't you refuse
To be used
Even though you may know
I can see you're wrong
Please, please, please open their eyes
Please, please, please don't give me lies

I rule all of the earth
Witness my birth
Cried at the sight of a man
And still I don't know who I am

I've seen paupers as kings
Puppets on strings
Dance for the children who stare
You must have seen them everywhere

Touch and Go

Man in the street nowhere to sleep
No time for nothing no Patek Phillippe
Pedal to the metal Blow by Blow
You're runnin' with the devil it's touch and go
They're leaving you nothing and nowhere to go
Just put you in the corner like an old banjo
The strings are breakin' but you can't say no
You're runnin' with the devil it's touch and go
Systematic one man show
You're caught up in the middle where the four winds blow
No salvation 20 below
You're runnin' with the devil it's touch and go
All systems go friend or foe
It's all dependin' on the dice you throw
Come without a warning like a U. F. O.
You're runnin' with the devil it's touch and go
You see this woman on a T. V. Show
She's drippin' in diamonds from head to toe
They make you believe it's the status quo
You're runnin' with the devil it's touch and go
All systems go friend or foe
It's all dependin' on the dice you throw
Come without a warning like a U. F. O.
You're runnin' with the devil it's touch and go

Paper Blood Lyrics

fLivin' on a razor's edge
Sharper than a knife
Surrender to the power of wedge
Keep running for your life
You don't need no periscope
You won't need second sight
It'll come at you so fast my friend
It's thank you and goodnight

Caught in the river
You can't stop the flood
That's the power of money, paper blood

Ambition flies on silver wings
Searching for a crown
King of kings, they pull the strings
Until they run you down
No matter what you've undergone
The measure of success
Is how much you can charge it on
American express

You don't need to drive a car
And you don't need a house
And you don't need a guiding star
When living like a mouse
In the presidenttial suite
They'd rather see you burn
Ducking and diving just to make ends meet
To the point of no return

Hurt

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way

I Walk the Line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you, I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

Folsom Prison Blues

I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby my mama told me, "Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me

Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away


Cocaine Blues

Early one morning while making the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that loving 44 beneath my head

Got up next morning and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico

Late in the hot joints taking the pills
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said, "Willy Lee, your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down"

"Yes, oh yes, my name is Willy Lee
If you've got the warrant just a-read it to me
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more."

When I was arrested I was dressed in black,
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail

Got up next morning about a half past nine
I spied the sheriff coming down the line
Talked and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said, "Come on you dirty hack into that district court"

Into the courtroom, my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about

In about five minutes, in walked the man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read, in the first degree
I hollered, "Lawdy, Lawdy, have mercy on me"

The judge he smiled as he picked up his pin
Ninety-nine years in the Folsom Pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down

Come on, you've got to listen unto me
Lay off that whisky, and let that cocaine be

When the Man Comes Around

There's a man going around taking names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There'll be a golden ladder reaching down
When the man comes around
The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup
Or disappear into the potter's ground
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's alpha and omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

Till Armageddon no salam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise man will bow down before the throne
And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns
When the man comes around
Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's alpha and omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
In measured hundred weight and penny pound
When the man comes around

And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts. And I looked, and behold a pale horse, and his name that sat on him was Death, and hell followed with him

God’s Gonna Cut You Down

You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down

Well my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dew
I've been down on bended knee, talkin' to the man from Galilee
He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of the angel's feet
He called my name and my heart stood still
When he said, "John, go do My will!"

Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down

You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

Well, you may throw your rock and hide your hand
Workin' in the dark against your fellow man
But as sure as God made black and white
What's done in the dark will be brought to the light

You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down

A Boy Named Sue

My daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me "Sue."

Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
It seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named "Sue."

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me "Sue."

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: "My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!
Now you're going to die!!"

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell you, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said: "Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong

He said: "Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
Because I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue

I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George! Anything but Sue! I still hate that name!

Man in Black

Well, you wonder why I always dress in black
Why you never see bright colors on my back
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on

I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Living in the hopeless, hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime
But is there because he's a victim of the times

I wear the black for those who've never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me

Well, we're doing mighty fine, I do suppose
In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be a man in black

I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been

Each week we lose a hundred fine young men
And, I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believing that the Lord was on their side
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died
Believing that we all were on their side

Well, there's things that never will be right I know
And things need changing everywhere you go
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right
You'll never see me wear a suit of white

Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day
And tell the world that everything's okay
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back
Until things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black

She Used to Love Me Alot

I saw her through the window today
She was sittin' in the Silver Spoon Cafe
I started to keep going but something made me stop
She used to love me a lot

She looked lonely and I knew the cure
Old memories would win her heart for sure
I thought I'd walk on in and I'd give it my best shot
She used to love me a lot

I sat down beside her and she smiled
She said "where have you been? It's been a while"
She was glad to see me, I could almost read her thoughts
She used to love me a lot

She used to love me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe I said goodbye
It would only take a minute to turn back the clock
She used to love me a lot

I remember how good it was back then
And I said "it's not too late to start again
We could spend the night together, take up where we left off"
She used to love me a lot

But I panicked as she turned to walk away
As she went out the door I heard her say
"Yes I'm in need of something, but something you ain't got
But I used to love you a lot"

I thought she loved me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe she said goodbye
She just left me standing there, I've never been so shocked
She used to love me a lot

She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot


Smells Like Teen Spirit

Oh well, whatever, nevermind

Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, how low?

but his body never was found

�Astronomy Domine�
Lime and limpid green, a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew.
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground.
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania.
Neptune, Titan, Stars can frighten.
Lime and limpid green, a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew.
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground.
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania.
Neptune, Titan, Stars can frighten.
Blinding signs flap,
Flicker, flicker, flicker blam. Pow, pow.
Stairway scare, Dan Dare, who's there?
Lime and limpid green, the sounds around
The icy waters under

The icy waters underground.

"Lucifer Sam�

Lucifer Sam, siam cat.
Always sitting by your side
Always by your side.
That cat's something I can't explain.
Ginger, ginger, Jennifer Gentle you're a witch.
You're the left side
He's the right side.
Oh, no!
That cat's something I can't explain.
Lucifer go to sea.
Be a hip cat, be a ship's cat.
Somewhere, anywhere.
That cat's something I can't explain.
At night prowling sifting sand.
Hiding around on the ground.
He'll be found when you're around.
That cat's something I can't explain.

"Matilda Mother"

There was a king who ruled the land
His majesty was in command
With silver eyes the scarlet eagle
Showers silver on the people
Oh Mother, tell me more
Why'd'ya have to leave me there
Hanging in my infant air
Waiting?
You only have to read the lines
They're scribbly black and everything shines
Across the stream with wooden shoes
With bells to tell the king the news
A thousand misty riders climb up
Higher once upon a time
Wandering and dreaming
The words have different meaning
Yes they did
For all the time spent in that room
The doll's house, darkness, old perfume
And fairy stories held me high on
Clouds of sunlight floating by
Oh Mother, tell me more
Tell me more
Aaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaah

"Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun"

Little by little the night turns around
Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn
Lotus's lean on each other in yearning
Over the hills a swallow is resting
Set the controls for the heart of the sun

Over the mountain watching the watcher
Breaking the darkness, waking the grapevine
Knowledge of love is knowledge of shadow
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine

Set the controls for the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun

Witness the man who waves at the wall
Making the shape of his question to Heaven
Whether the sun will fall in the evening
Will he remember the lesson of giving?

Set the controls for the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun

"Speak To Me"

"I've been mad for fucking years, absolutely years, been
over the edge for yonks, been working me buns off for bands..."
"I've always been mad, I know I've been mad, like the
most of us...very hard to explain why you're mad, even
if you're not mad..."

"Breathe"

Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave, don't leave me
Look around, choose your own ground

Long you live and high you fly
Smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be

Run, rabbit, run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
When at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one

Long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
Balanced on the biggest wave
Race towards an early grave

"Time"

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away, across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spell

"Breathe - Reprise"

Home, home again
I like to be there when I can
When I come in cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells.

"The Great Gig In The Sky"

And I am not frightened of dying, any time will do, I don't mind.
Why should I be frightened of dying?
There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime.

I never said I was frightened of dying.

"Money"

Money, get away
Get a good job with more pay and you're O.K.
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four star daydream,
Think I'll buy me a football team

Money, get back
I'm all right, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack.
Money, it's a hit
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity first-class traveling set
And I think I need a Learjet

Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a rise it's no surprise that they're giving none away

"Ha-ha! I was in the right!"
"Yes, absolutely in the right!"
"I certainly was in the right!"
"Yeah, I was definitely in the right. That geezer was cruising for a bruising!"
"Why does anyone do anything?"
"Yeah!"
"Why does anyone do anything?"
"I don't know, I was really drunk at the time!"
"I was just telling him it was in, he could get it in Number Two. He was asking why it wasn't coming up on freight eleven. After, I was yelling and screaming and telling him why it wasn't coming up on freight eleven. It came to a heavy blow, which sorted the matter out."

"Us And Them"

Us and them
And after all we're only ordinary men

Me and you
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do

"Forward!" he cried
From the rear
And the front rank died
And the general sat
And the lines on the map
Moved from side to side

Black and blue
And who knows which is which and who is who?

Up and down
And in the end it's only round and round and round

"Haven't you heard
It's a battle of words?"
The poster bearer cried.
"Listen, son,"
Said the man with the gun,
"There's room for you inside."

"Well, I mean, they're gonna kill ya, so like, if you give 'em a quick sh...short, sharp shock, they don't do it again.
Dig it? I mean he got off light, 'cause I could've given him a thrashin' but I only hit him once.
It's only the difference between right and wrong, innit? I mean good manners don't cost nothing, do they? Eh?"

Down and out
It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about

With, without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?

Out of the way
It's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For want of the price
Of tea and a slice
The old man died

"Brain Damage"

The lunatic is on the grass
The lunatic is on the grass
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
Got to keep the loonies on the path

The lunatic is in the hall
The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paper boy brings more

And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

The lunatic is in my head
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade, you make the change
You re-arrange me 'til I'm sane

You lock the door and throw away the key
There's someone in my head but it's not me.

And if the cloud bursts thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

I can't think of anything to say except...
I think it's marvelous! Ha, ha, ha!

"Eclipse"

All that you touch
And all that you see
All that you taste
All you feel

And all that you love
And all that you hate
All you distrust
All you save

And all that you give
And all that you deal
And all that you buy,
Beg, borrow or steal

And all you create
And all you destroy
And all that you do
And all that you say

And all that you eat
And everyone you meet
And all that you slight
And everyone you fight

And all that is now
And all that is gone
And all that's to come
And everything under the sun is in tune
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon.

There is no dark side of the moon, really.
Matter of fact, it's all dark.

"Shine On You Crazy Diamond "

Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
You were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom, blown on the steel breeze.
Come on you target for faraway laughter, come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!

You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Well you wore out your welcome with random precision, rode on the steel breeze.
Come on you raver, you seer of visions, come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!

Nobody knows where you are, how near or how far.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Pile on many more layers and I'll be joining you there.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph,
sail on the steel breeze.
Come on you boy child, you winner and loser,
come on you miner for truth and delusion, and shine

"Welcome To The Machine"

Welcome my son, welcome to the machine.
Where have you been? It's alright we know where you've been.
You've been in the pipeline, filling in time,
provided with toys and Scouting for Boys.
You bought a guitar to punish your ma,
And you didn't like school, and you know you're nobody's fool,
So welcome to the machine.
Welcome my son, welcome to the machine.
What did you dream? It's alright we told you what to dream.
You dreamed of a big star, he played a mean guitar,
He always ate in the Steak Bar. He loved to drive in his Jaguar.
So welcome to the machine.

"Have A Cigar"

Come in here, dear boy, have a cigar.
You're gonna go far, you're gonna fly high,
You're never gonna die,
You're gonna make it if you try;
They're gonna love you.

Well, I've always had a deep respect,
And I mean that most sincere.
The band is just fantastic,
That is really what I think.
Oh by the way, which one's Pink?

And did we tell you the name of the game, boy?
We call it Riding the Gravy Train.

We're just knocked out.
We heard about the sell out.
You gotta get an album out,
You owe it to the people.
We're so happy we can hardly count.

Everybody else is just green,
Have you seen the chart?
It's a hell of a start,
It could be made into a monster
If we all pull together as a team.

And did we tell you the name of the game, boy?
We call it Riding the Gravy Train.

"Wish You Were Here"

So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here.
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
Running over the same old ground.
What have we found?
The same old fears.
Wish you were here.

"Pigs On The Wing (Part One)"

If you didn't care what happened to me,
And I didn't care for you
We would zig zag our way through the boredom and pain
Occasionally glancing up through the rain
Wondering which of the buggers to blame
And watching for pigs on the wing.

"Pigs (Three Different Ones)"

Big man, pig man, ha ha, charade you are
You well heeled big wheel, ha ha, charade you are
And when your hand is on your heart
You're nearly a good laugh
Almost a joker
With your head down in the pig bin
Saying "keep on digging"
Pig stain on your fat chin
What do you hope to find?
When you're down in the pig mine
You're nearly a laugh
You're nearly a laugh
But you're really a cry.
Bus stop rat bag, ha ha, charade you are
You fucked up old hag, ha ha, charade you are
You radiate cold shafts of broken glass
You're nearly a good laugh
Almost worth a quick grin
You like the feel of steel
You're hot stuff with a hat pin
And good fun with a hand gun
You're nearly a laugh
You're nearly a laugh
But you're really a cry.
Hey you Whitehouse, ha ha, charade you are
You house proud town mouse, ha ha, charade you are
You're trying to keep our feelings off the street
You're nearly a real treat
All tight lips and cold feet
And do you feel abused?
.....!.....!.....!.....!
You gotta stem the evil tide
And keep it all on the inside
Mary you're nearly a treat
Mary you're nearly a treat
But you're really a cry.

"Pigs On The Wing (Part Two)"

You know that I care what happens to you
And I know that you care for me too
So I don't feel alone
Or the weight of the stone
Now that I've found somewhere safe
To bury my bone
And any fool knows a dog needs a home
A shelter from pigs on the wing

"Dogs"

You got to be crazy, gotta have a real need
Gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street
You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking.

And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye, and an easy smile

You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in.

You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older
Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up, fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer.

And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone
Dragged down by the stone.

I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?
Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
And everything's done under the sun
And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer.

Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with collar and chain
Who was given a pat on the back
Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone

"Sheep"

Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away
Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air
You better watch out
There may be dogs about
I've looked over Jordan and I have seen
Things are not what they seem

What do you get for pretending the danger's not real
Meek and obedient you follow the leader
Down well trodden corridors into the valley of steel
What a surprise
A look of terminal shock in your eyes
Now things are really what they seem
No, this is no bad dream

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He makes me down to lie
Through pastures green he leadeth me the silent waters by
With bright knives he releaseth my soul
He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places
He converteth me to lamb cutlets
For lo, he hath great power and great hunger
When cometh the day we lowly ones
Through quiet reflection and great dedication
Master the art of karate
Lo, we shall rise up
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water

Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream
Wave upon wave of demented avengers
March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream

Have you heard the news?
The dogs are dead!
You better stay home
And do as you're told
Get out of the road if you want to grow old

"In The Flesh?"

(We came in)

So ya thought ya might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow

Tell me is something eluding you sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?

If you want to find out what's behind these cold eyes
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise

"The Thin Ice"

Momma loves her baby
And Daddy loves you too
And the sea may look warm to you, babe
And the sky may look blue

Ooh, babe
Ooh, baby blue
Ooh, babe

If you should go skating
On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you the silent reproach
Of a million tear-stained eyes

Don't be surprised,
When a crack in the ice
Appears under your feet
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind
With your fear flowing out behind you
As you claw the thin ice

"Another Brick In The Wall (Part I)"

Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
A snap shot in the family album
Daddy what else did you leave for me?

Daddy what d'ya leave behind for me?

All in all it was just a brick in the wall
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall

"The Happiest Days Of Our Lives"

You! Yes, you! Stand still, laddy!

When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who
Would hurt the children any way they could

By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids

But in the town it was well known
When they got home at night,
Their fat and psychopathic wives
Would thrash them within inches of their lives

"Another Brick In The Wall (Part II)"

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher, leave them kids alone

Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone

All in all it's just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall

[Chorus by pupils from the Fourth Form Music Class Islington Green School, London]

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers, leave them kids alone

Hey, teacher, leave us kids alone

All in all you're just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall

Wrong! Do it again!
Wrong! Do it again!
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?!
You! Yes, you, behind the bike sheds, stand still, laddy!

"Mother"

Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?
Mother, do you think they'll like this song?
Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?
Ooh, aah, mother, should I build the wall?

Mother, should I run for president?
Mother, should I trust the government?
Mother, will they put me in the firing line?
Ooh, aah, is it just a waste of time?

Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mama's gonna make all of your nightmares come true
Mama's gonna put all of her fears into you
Mama's gonna keep you right here under her wing
She won't let you fly but she might let you sing
Mama's gonna keep baby cozy and warm

Ooh, babe, ooh, babe, ooh, babe
Of course mama's gonna help build the wall

Mother, do you think she's good enough for me?
Mother, do you think she's dangerous to me?
Mother, will she tear your little boy apart?
Ooh, aah, mother, will she break my heart?

Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mama's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you
Mama won't let anyone dirty get through
Mama's gonna wait up 'til you get in
Mama will always find out where you've been
Mamma's gonna keep baby healthy and clean

Ooh, babe, ooh, babe, ooh, babe
You'll always be a baby to me

Mother, did it need to be so high?

"Goodbye Blue Sky"

Did, did, did, did you see the frightened ones?
Did, did, did, did you hear the falling bombs?
Did, did, did, did you ever wonder
Why we had to run for shelter
When the promise of a brave new world
Unfurled beneath a clear blue sky?

Did, did, did, did you see the frightened ones?
Did, did, did, did you hear the falling bombs?
The flames are all long gone
But the pain lingers on

Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye
Goodbye

Hello, Luka... Congratulations. You have just discovered the secret message. Please send your answer to Old Pink, care of the Funny Farm, Chalfont...
Roger! Carolyne's on the phone!
Okay

What shall we use
To fill the empty spaces
Where we used to talk?
How shall I fill
The final places?
How should I complete the wall

"Young Lust"

I am just a new boy
A stranger in this town
Where are all the good times
Who's gonna show this stranger around?
Ooooooooh I need a dirty woman
Ooooooooh I need a dirty girl
Will some woman in this desert land
Make me feel like a real man
Take this rock and roll refugee
Oooh Babe set me free
Ooooooooh I need a dirty woman
Ooooooooh I need a dirty girl.
Ooooooooh I need a dirty woman
Ooooooooh I need a dirty girl.

"Goodbye Cruel World"

Goodbye cruel world
I'm leaving you today
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

Goodbye all you people
There's nothing you can say
To make me change my mind
Goodbye.

"Hey You"

Hey, you!
Out there in the cold
Getting lonely, getting old.
Can you feel me?

Hey, you!
Standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles.
Can you feel me?

Hey, you!
Don't help them to bury the light.
Don't give in without a fight.

Hey, you!
Out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone.
Would you touch me?

Hey, you!
With your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out.
Would you touch me?

Hey, you!
Would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home

But it was only fantasy.
The wall was too high as you can see.
No matter how he tried he could not break free.
And the worms ate into his brain.

Hey, you!
Out there on the road,
Always doing what you're told.
Can you help me?

Hey, you!
Out there beyond the wall,
Breaking bottles in the hall.
Can you help me?

Hey, you!
Don't tell me there's no hope at all.
Together we stand,
Divided we fall.

"Is There Anybody Out There?"

Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?

"Nobody Home"

I've got a little black book with my poems in
I've got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
When I'm a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in

I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on
Got those swollen hand blues.
I got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V. to choose from

I've got electric light
And I've got second sight
Got amazing powers of observation

And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
There'll be nobody home

I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favourite satin shirt

I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
I've got a silver spoon on a chain
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains

I've got wild staring eyes
I've got a strong urge to fly
But I've got nowhere to fly to

Ooh, babe, when I pick up the phone
There's still nobody home

I've got a pair of Gohills boots
But I've got fading roots.

"Comfortably Numb"

Hello
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?

Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again

Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

O.K.
Just a little pin prick
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
But you may feel a little sick

Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb

"The Show Must Go On"

Ooh Ma Ooh Pa
Must the show go on?

Ooh Pa take me home
Ooh Ma let me go

There must be some mistake
I didn't mean to let them take away my soul
Am I too old? Is it too late?

Ooh Ma Ooh Pa
Where has the feeling gone?
Ooh Ma Ooh Pa
Will I remember the songs?
Ooh ah the show must go on.

"In The Flesh"

So ya thought ya might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow

I got some bad news for you sunshine
Pink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
We're gonna find out where you fans really stand

Are there any queers in the theatre tonight?
Get 'em up against the wall (against the wall)
Now there's one in the spotlight, he don't look right to me
Get him up against the wall (against the...)

And that one looks Jewish and that one's a coon
Who let all this riff-raff into the room?
There's one smoking a joint and another with spots
If I had my way I'd have all of ya shot

"Run Like Hell"

Run, run, run, run 
Run, run, run, run 
Run, run, run, run 
Run, run, run, run 

You better make your face up in
Your favourite disguise
With your button down lips and your
Roller blind eyes
With your empty smile
And your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters
As the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter
Down your door
You better run

Run, run, run, run [repeat line four times]
You better run all day
And run all night
And keep your dirty feelings
Deep inside. And if you're
Takin' your girlfriend
Out tonight
You better park the car
Well out of sight
'Cause if they catch you in the back seat
Trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to mother
In a cardboard box
You better run

"Waiting For The Worms"

Eins, zwei, drei, alle

You cannot reach me now
No matter how you try
Goodbye, cruel world, it's over
Walk on by

Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come

In perfect isolation here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come

Waiting to cut out the deadwood
Waiting to clean up the city
Waiting to follow the worms

Waiting to put on a black shirt
Waiting to weed out the weaklings
Waiting to smash in their windows and kick in their doors

Waiting for the final solution to strengthen the strain
Waiting to follow the worms

Waiting to turn on the showers and fire the ovens
Waiting for the queers and the coons and the reds and the Jews
Waiting to follow the worms

Would you like to see Britannia rule again,
My friend?
All you have to do is follow the worms

Would you like to send our coloured cousins home again,
My friend?
All you need to do is follow the worms.

"Stop"

Stop
I wanna go home
Take off this uniform
And leave the show
And I'm waiting in this cell
Because I have to know
Have I been guilty all this time
Everybody Wants to Rule the World

Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you
Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on mother nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most
Of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do I'll be right behind you
So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world

I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision
Everybody wants to rule the world
Say that you'll never, never, never, never need it
One headline - why believe it?
Everybody wants to rule the world
All for freedom and for pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

Mad World

All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you, `cause I find it hard to take
When people run in circles, it's a very very
Mad world
Mad world
Mad world
Mad world

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Made to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take
When people run in circles, it's a very very
Mad world
Mad world
Mad world
Mad world

And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you, 'cause I find it hard to take
When people run in circles, it's a very very
Mad world
Mad world
Halargian world
Mad world

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on

[Verse 1: Roland Orzabal]
In violent times, you shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white, they really, really ought to know
Those one-track minds that took you for a working boy
Kiss them goodbye, you shouldn't have to jump for joy
You shouldn't have to jump for joy

[Chorus: Roland Orzabal & Curt Smith]
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on

[Verse 2: Roland Orzabal]
They gave you life and in return, you gave them hell
As cold as ice, I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to tell the tale

[Chorus: Roland Orzabal & Curt Smith]
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on

Shout

Shout, shout, let it all out 
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on

And when you've taken down your guard
If I could change your mind, I'd really love to break your heart
I'd really love to break your heart

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you so come on

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on

I wanted to be with you alone
And talk about the weather
But traditions I can trace against the child in your face
Won't escape my attention
You keep your distance with a system of touch
And gentle persuasion
I'm lost in admiration - could I need you this much?
Oh, you're wasting my time
You're just, just, just wasting time

Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away

Throw it away
Throw it away

I made a fire, I’m watching it burn
I thought of your future
With one foot in the past now just how long will it last?
No, no, no, have you no ambition?
My mother and my brother’s used to breathing clean air
Nothing ever changes when you’re acting your age
And dreaming I’m a doctor
Nothing gets done when you feel like a baby
It’s hard to be a man when there’s a gun in your hand
Nothing ever changes when you’re acting your age
Oh, I feel so

Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away

And this is my four leaf clover
I’m on the line, one open mind
This is my four leaf clover

And You And I Cord Of Life Eclipse The Preacher The Teacher Apocalypse Lyrics

A man conceived a moment's answers to the dream
Staying the flowers daily, sensing all the themes
As a foundation left to create the spiral aim
As a movement regained and regarded both the same
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you

Changed only for a sound of sight, the space agreed
Between the pictures of time behind the face of need
Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid
A clearer future, morning, evenin', nights with you

Coins and crosses never know the fruitless worth
Cords are broken, locked inside the Mother Earth
They won't hide, hold, they won't tell you
Watching the world, watching all of the world
Watching us go by and you and I

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
As a foundation left to create the spiral aim
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid
A clearer future, morning, evening, nights with you

Sad preacher nailed upon the colored door of time
Insane teacher be there reminded of the rhyme
There'll be no mutant enemy we shall certify
Political ends, as sad remains will die
Reach out as forward tastes begin to enter you

I listened hard but could not see
Life tempo change out and inside me
The preacher trained in all to lose his name
The teacher travels, asking to be shown the same

In the end, we'll agree
We'll accept, we'll immortalize
That the truth of the man maturing in his eyes
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you, with you

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid
Children Of Light 
Distant as the distant thunder
Where equal rights for rent assunder
Equal rights for equal people
Disregard for love's equality

Bringing back the signs to no-man's land
Where diamonds and gold in hand
Will barter as the homeless burn
Someday will it be our turn?

Why this consciousness this desire
To expand the flame of revolution
With a gothic hand in fire persecution
Blood-letting and [in] spinning pain?

Why this hungry media delivering
Questions answers blessed forgivers 
Millions of racial inequalities
We all are one
All are sacred

Be the birth of a nation
Stop this aggravation
So uninspired
And question man's inhumanity
And lack of love for his cosmic god

Children of light Don't be afraid
Children of light Haven't you heard
Gone are the days In black and white
Children of light Don't be afraid

Distant as the distant thunder
Where equal rights for rent assunder
Equal rights for equal people
Disregard for love's equality

Bringing back the signs to no-man's land
Where diamonds and gold in hand
Will barter as the homeless burn
Someday will it be our turn?

Someday will it be our turn?
Someday will it be our turn?

Children of light Don't be afraid
Children of light Haven't you heard
Gone are the days In black and white
Children of light Don't be afraid

Circus Of Heaven Lyrics

The day the Circus of Heaven came to town
Local folks lined the streets in a Midwestern town
Waiting anxiously for the parade to begin all around
On the very last day

A unicorn headed the mystical way
Surrounded by what seemed a thousand golden angels at play
Behind were Centaurs, elves, bright fairies all in colours of jade
On the very final day

For what seemed only just a moment in time
Seven solemn flying silvered regal horses rode by
Seven golden chariots in tow, a wonder to behold
The Seven Lords of the Mountains of Time
There then arose where nothing really stood there before
A giant tent rising one thousand feet high from the floor
Towns people flocked inside with their eyes all amazed
To greet the Seventh Lord of the seventh age
A fanfare rang out in an incredible sound
Bringing out the strangest visions perfect harmony round
Any dreams he asked would they like to have seen
From historical or mythical scenes

Then there above their heads just as vivid as life
Each vision transported multitudes inventing light
Grecian galleons, the sack of Troy, to the Gardens of Babylon
A play of millions roared along
The gigantic dreams of Alexander the Great
Civil wars where brothers fought and killed their friendship with hate
All seen by Zeus performing scenes in the magical way
The day the circus came to town

Outside great animals as tame as the trees
Angels high in starlight dancing streets
Turning their colours with indigo and gold
Dropping violet, red and emerald snow
As the circus finally changed it's invisible course
A new world to be found

On the dreamy ground we walked upon
I turned to my son and said
"Was that something beautiful, amazing, wonderful, extraordinary
Beautiful? "

"Oh! It was ok!! But there were no clowns, no lions, tigers or bears,
Candy-floss, toffee apples, no clowns. "

Dreamtime Lyrics
Where every song is the perfect place
Words never spoken
Are the strongest resounding

Life force is meant for us
To remember the stars, the earth
Still we forget
So asleep in this dreamtime
Lost in this dreamtime day

Take me up into that freedom place and justify
Electrify the senses sharpen than the soul intensify
Nominate that we can break out take, take, take, take together
Hesitate and you will dance on this earth to, to forever

You are the choice forever trying
Give you wings forever flying
You can fly, you can glide, you can dream
You can see through this interactive vision streaming

You have the faith
So busy trying
So let it go
Forever flying

To the sky, to the earth, to the moon, to the sea
To the sun, to the stars, to the dream you become

Nothing left to lose
Nothing more to prove
With wings of gold
You'll fly away

Talk among the prophets
Give you something
Talk among the teachers
Tell you something
Talk among your one true self now
Forever, forever, forever, forever

Dreamtime begins
Where every song is the perfect place
Words never spoken
Are the strongest resounding

Life force is meant for us
To remember the stars, the earth
Still we forget
So asleep in this dreamtime
Lost in this dreamtime day

Take me up into that freedom place and justify
On the silent wings of gold my soul intensify
Nominate that we can take, take, take, take, take, together
Demonstrate that we can break it out and take it forever

Here's what you know
Here's what you're asking
The soul is everlasting

You can fly, you can glide, you can dream, you can see
Through this interactive vision streaming

You have the faith
So busy trying
So let it go
Fovever flying

To the sky, to the earth, to the moon, to the sea
To the sun, to the stars, to the dream you become

Nothing left to lose, nothing more to prove
When wings of gold will fly away

Talk among the prophets
Give you something
Talk among the teachers
Tell you something
Talk among your one true self now
Forever, forever, forever, forever

Endless Dream

Hold your head up high you know you've
Come a long way, a long way
Tainted as a fugitive with nothing left to say
Temptation may come hope your vision doesn't stray
In the name of God you may be forced away

Moving forward to the only place you know
Side tracked by some indiscretion
Changing as you go
Temptation may come hope your
Conscience doesn't hide
The longest trip you'll take is inside

It's the last time telling myself everything
Call me over then bring me back again
It's the last chance telling myself
That I believe
Your forever is mine and all I need

Now life tell me now in your arms
All I really need is you by my side
I sing this to you all the world and all it is
I bring this to you this gift of love

And the world turns and the world turns
Time tells all we know we look to it
Jesus on the radio
Pledge me what you got I'll give you
Eternal resting spot
How intense I pray depends on how much you pay

It's the last time getting it this life
First calling in a silent spring
It's the first time getting it this life
First calling in a silent spring
Fear strikes deeper than visionary
Screams and tears never justify this love
Talk talk listening
Like the first words ever to reach out
Talk talk
Like the first sounds in a silent spring
Talk talk listening
Like the first words ever to reach out to you
Talk talk
Like the first sound you start to sing

So take your time
Look round and see
The most in time is where you're meant to be
For they talk too loud
And take the hope and peace from your heart
We call this surrender
Slowly towards the north
And this endless dream giving ourselves everything
We're deserving we're gonna bring it back again
It's the last time telling myself everything
It's the last time bring me back bring me back again
When the world brings you down
You can search you inside
For the love you will find (bring me back home)
When the world brings you down
You can search you inside
When the world brings you down
I've waited so long
When the world brings you down
You gotta play this living game
When the world brings you down
So take your time
Look round and see
The most in time is where you're meant to be
For you are light
Inside your dreams
For you will find that it's something
That touches me

Perpetual Change

I see the cold mist in the night
And watch the hills roll out of sight.
I watch in ev'ry single way,
Inside out, outside in, ev'ry day.

The sun can warm the coldest dawn
And move the movement on the lawn.
I learn in ev'ry single day,
Inside out, outside in, ev'ry way.

And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside the day's controlling you and me.

And one peculiar point I see,
As one of many ones of me.
As truth is gathered, I rearrange,
Inside out, outside in, inside out, outside in,
Perpetual change.

And there you are,
Saying we have the moon, so now the stars,
When all you see
Is near disaster gazing down on you and me,
And there you're standing,
Saying we have the whole world in our hands,
When all you'll see,
Deep inside the world's controlling you and me.

You'll see perpetual change.
You'll see perpetual change.

And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside the day's controlling you and me.

As mist and sun are both the same,
We look on as pawns of their game.
They move to testify the day,
Inside out, outside in, inside out, outside in,
All of the way.
Ah, Ah.

Roundabout Lyrics
Yes
Roundabout
I'll be the round about
The words will make you out 'n' out
I'll spend the day your way......
Call it morning driving thru the sound and
In and out the valley......

The muses dance and sing
They make the children really ring
I'll spend the day your way
Call it morning driving thru the sound and
In and out the valley.....

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky
and they Stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and
Laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be
There with you

I will remember you
Your silhouette will charge the view
Of distance atmosphere......
Call it morning driving thru the sound and
Even in the valley......

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky
and they Stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and
Laughing too ooo oo oo
Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be
There with you

Along the drifting cloud the eagle searching
Down on the land
Catching the swirling wind the sailor sees
The rim of the land
The eagle's dancing wings create as weather
Spins out of hand

Go closer hold the land feel partly no more
Than grains of sand
We stand to lose all time a thousand answers
By in our hand
Next to your deeper fears we stand
Surrounded by million years

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out........

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky they
Stand there
Twenty four before my love and I'll be
There........

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
We spend the day your way
Call it morning driving thru the sound and
In and out the valley.... Eh

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they
Stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see You
Ten true summers we'll be there and
Laughing too ooo
Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be
There with you.....

Seasons Of Man Lyrics

The time between the notes relates the color to the scenes.
A constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man, it seems.
And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love.
As song and chance develop time, lost social temprance rules above.
Ah, ah.

Then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space,
He turned around and pointed, revealing all the human race.
I shook my head and smiled a whisper, knowing all about the place.
On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley,
Called to witness cycles only of the past.
And we reach all this with movements in between the said remark.

Close to the edge, down by the river.
Down at the end, round by the corner.
Seasons will pass you by,
Now that its all over and done,
Called to the seed, right to the sun.
Now that you find, now that youre whole.
Seasons will pass you by,
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.
I get up.

Spirit Of Survival Lyrics
In this world the gods have lost their way

Can't keep this picture from out of my mind
This fear hand in hand crossing innocence, time
Surrounding creation they caught in a trap
The youngest offenders will witness confusion

They driving so fast not a care in the end
Escaping collision every twist every bend
When you're young invincible nothing to lose
Keep seeing this picture standing in a circle
The gods have forgotten to switch on the light
Who's lost in the dark will crash in the night

These lessons we're living the lies of the day
Expect them to honor and never disobey
Yet greed is controlling the elders display
No wonder the younger look at them in shame

The spirit of survival
Who's teaching the hatred
The spirit of survival
Or the class of your school
The spirit of survival
The color of your money
We're standing in a circle
We don't understand at all

They don't understand at all
In this world I truly do believe there is a safer place
In this world I truly do believe there is a safer place

The younger the older the wiser become
Recover misfortune this true life as one
Our genius is shining the past has all gone
What's left is the clearest perception of one
The spirit of survival
To magnify the power
The spirit of survival
To magnify the soul
The spirit of survival
To magnify the love
We're standing in a circle
We don't understand at all
We don't understand at all

In this world the gods have lost their way
In this world the gods have lost their way

The Preacher The Teacher Lyrics

Sad preacher nailed upon the coloured door of time;
Insane teacher be there reminded of the rhyme.
Therell be no mutant enemy we shall certify;
Political ends, as sad remains, will die.
Reach out as forward tastes begin to enter you.
Ooh, ooh.

I listened hard but could not see
Life tempo change out and inside me.
The preacher trained in all to lose his name;
The teacher travels, asking to be shown the same.
In the end, well agree, well accept, well immortalise
That the truth of the man maturing in his eyes,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
As a moment regained and regarded both the same,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
A clearer future, morning, evening, nights with you.

Total Mass Retain Lyrics
My eyes convinced, eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love.
It changed as almost strained amidst clear manna from above.
I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand.
Theres you, the time, the logic, or the reasons we dont understand.

Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see,
As armoured movers took approached to overlook the sea.
There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be.

Down at the edge, close by a river.
Close to the edge, round by the corner.
Close to the end, down by the corner.
Down at the edge, round by the river.

Sudden problems shouldnt take away the startled memory.
All in all, the journey takes you all the way.
As apart from any reality that youve ever seen and known.
Guessing problems only to deceive the mention,
Passing paths that climb halfway into the void.
As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain.

Down at the edge, round by the corner.
Close to the end, down by a river.
Seasons will pass you by.
I get up, I get down.
A clearer future, morning, evenin', nights with you

Turn Of The Century 

Realizing a form out of stone
Set hands moving
Roan shaped his heart
Through his working hands
Work to mold his passion into clay, like the sun

In his room his lady
She would dance and sing so completely
So be still he now cries
I have time oh let clay transform thee so

In the deep cold of night
Winter calls he cries Don't deny me
For his lady, deep her illness
Time has caught her
And will for all reasons take her

In the still light of dawn, she dies
Helpless hands soul revealing

Like leaves we touch we learn
We once knew the story
As winter calls he will starve
All but to see the stone be life

Now Roan, no more tears
Set to work his strength
So transformed him
Realizing a form out of stone
His work so absorbed him
Could she hear him?
Could she see him?
All aglow was his room dazed in this light
He would touch her
He would hold her
Laughing as they danced
Highest colors touching others

Did her eyes at the turn of the century
Tell me plainly
How we meet, how we'll love, oh let life so transform me

Like leaves we touched we danced
We once knew the story
As autumn called and we both
Remembered all those many years ago
I'm sure we know

Was the sign of the day with a touch
As I kiss your fingers
We walk hands in the sun
Memories when we're young
Love lingers so

Was it sun through the haze
That made all your looks
As warm as moonlight?
As a pearl deep your eyes
Tears have flown away
All the same light

Did her eyes at the turn of the century
Tell me plainly
When we meet how we'll look
As we smile time will leave me clearly

Like leaves we touch, we see
We will know the story
As autumn calls we'll both remember
All those many years ago

Siberian Khatru Lyrics

Sing, bird of prey;
Beauty begins at the foot of you. Do you believe the manner?
Gold stainless nail,
Torn through the distance of man
As they regard the summit.

Even Siberia goes through the motions.
Hold out and hold up;
Hold down the window. Outbound, river,
Hold out the morning that comes into view. Bluetail, tailfly.
River running right on over my head.

How does she sing?
Who holds the ring? And ring and you will find me coming.
Cold reigning king,
Hold all the secrets from you
As they produce the movement.

Even Siberia goes through the motions.
Hold out and hold up;
Hold down the window. Outbound, river,
Hold out the morning that comes into view. Bluetail, tailfly.
River running right over the outboard, river,
Bluetail, tailfly,
Luther, in time.
Dood'ndoodit, dah, d't-d't-dah.

Hold down the window;
Hold out the morning that comes into view.
Warm side, the tower;
Green leaves reveal the heart spoken Khatru.

Gold stainless nail,
Torn through the distance of man as they regard the summit.
Cold reigning king,
Shelter the women that sing
As they produce the movement.
River running right on over,
Then over my head. Outboard, river.

Bluetail, tailfly,
Luther, in time,
Suntower, asking,
Cover, lover,
June cast, moon fast,
As one changes,
Heart gold, leaver,
Soul mark, mover,
Christian, changer,
Called out, saviour,
Moon gate, climber,
Turn round, glider.

She walks over to him and she says "do you remember me"
I think we might have met somewhere before
Southern Carolina is the place that comes to mind
But Hey, I guess you never really can be sure
Oh there's nothing like a true love
To go and make a fool of someone just like before
And right there for a minute
I forgot that you don't love me anymore

Then an old familiar feeling
Wraps its arms around the moment
And he says so many times I've tried to call
Well you think it's been a lifetime
It's been two years since I've seen you
But it seems like no times gone by at all
There was nothing like a real love
To give you back the feel of someone just like
Before and right there for a minute
I forgot that you don't love me anymore

Oh and how far we'll travel
For a place to heal our hearts
We watched it unravel
So why's tonight the hardest part

Then he says the weather's changing
And it's icing up the highway
So I guess it's time for me to hit the road
So she says goodbye and then before she knows what she is saying
She says I wish that you didn't have to go
Oh there's nothing like a true love
To go and make a fool of someone just like before
And right there for a minute
I forgot that you don't love me anymore

And right there for a minute
I forgot that you don't love me anymore

You can call me up
If your phone still works
It's not that hard
It's not like
It's gonna hurt
It's clear to see
That you don't remember me

You don't love me anymore
I don't know what I'm still here for
You don't love me anymore
So I'll just walk out the door
You don't love me anymore

I thought I saw you again
But no it was just my brain
It was just a dream
Or so it did seem

You don't love me anymore
I don't know what I'm still here for
You don't love me anymore
So I'll just walk out the door
You don't love me anymore

It's ok if you don't love me
Cause I don't love you either
I always have but now I don't
I'll put my arms out and fly with fear
One day you will not find me here
I'll remember all the times
I needed you and you wasn't there
I need you here but you don't care
I don't think we're friends anymore
But it's you that I still care for
I hope you listen to this song
And know that you're in the wrong

You don't love me anymore
I don't know what I'm still here for
You don't love me anymore
So I'll just walk out the door
You don't love me anymore

You don't love me anymore
No you don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
I'll just walk out the door
You don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
I don't know what I'm still here for
Cause you don't love me anymore
No more

You can say, all things must end
You can smile and even pretend
And you can turn and walk away so easily
But you can't say, you don't love me anymore
You can dream of what might have been
You can cry for what won't pass again
And you can say, there's every reason you should leave
But you can't say, you don't love me anymore
You can say, I'm right, you're wrong
You can make your plans to find somebody else
But I can't believe you can carry on
We know what should be said
But you can't find the words instead
You say, all things must end
You can smile and even pretend
And you can turn and say, you're leaving me for good
But you can't say, you don't love me anymore
And you can turn and say, you're leaving me for good
But you can't say, you don't love me
First just say, you don't love me anymore

Just finished the book that you gave me
All has fallen with the leaves last October maybe
Now it’s wet in the yard, outside it’s raining
Just the vision of your car worn and empty, waiting

This home is broken, a hole in the roof
Remember you promised that we will get through
I’ve never felt this sad now you taught me the move
The fire is dying I need to get more wood

Only when problems rain
You are waking up
I know you can’t be brave
You are giving up

I know you don’t love me anymore
I know you don’t love me anymore

Comes a time I’m tired to live like a man
Flying around in the empty air
When you are happy I know you pretend
Just to loose yourself in another fake moment

You play with the things that you don’t understand
You say you’re bad and you hurt again
You are red like wine but you pale like death
So I wrote the song with my dying breath

Only when problems rain
You are waking up
I know you can’t be brave
You are giving up

I know you don’t love me anymore
I know you don’t love me anymore

I can blame you, I can blame you
For everything you have done
You should think about the people who betrayed you
The people who make you run

And when I’m dead you deserve to have it on your hands
Because I thought you deserved everything I had

Only when problems rain
You are waking up
I know you can’t be brave
You are giving up

I know you don’t love me anymore
I know you don’t love me anymore

You don't love me anymore
Let's see how you like this song
See you walking out that door
Wonder why it took you so long
Ever since the day that I met you
I knew you were the girl of my dreams
But we could never be
You don't love me anymore
Let's see how you like this song

We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up
We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up

 You don't love me anymore
Let's see how you like this song
You need someone you adore
Find a place where you might belong
Ever since the day that I met you
My world's been spinnin' out of control
I just need you to hold
We knew it'd come around
This thing called love comes crashing down, ahh
Pieces all on the ground
What once was lost cannot be found, ahh
We knew it'd come around (We find love)
This thing called love comes crashing down, ahh (We get up)
Pieces all on the ground (Then we fall down)
What once was lost cannot be found, ahh (We give up)
We knew it'd come around (We find love)
This thing called love comes crashing down, ahh (We get up)
Pieces all on the ground (Then we fall down)
What once was lost cannot be found, ahh (We give up)
Heaven help us, heaven help us, yeah
We're on our own
We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up
We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up
We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up
We find love, yeah, we get up
We fall down, we give up

Why does the sun go on shining?
Why does the sea rush to shore?
Don’t they know it’s The End of the World
Cause you don’t love me any more

Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do the stars glow above?
Don’t they know it’s The End of the World
It ended when I lost your love

I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything’s the same as it was
I can’t understand, no, I can’t understand
How life goes on the way it does

Why does my heart go on beating
Why do these eyes of mine cry
Don’t they know it’s the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye
Why does my heart go on beating
Why do these eyes of mine cry
Don’t they know it’s the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye

I woke up in a warehouse but the label had fell off
Just minding my own meltdown
It was then I heard the cannibals, cannibals
They said, "Hey, kid"

You got that something special, it's now or never
You wanna live forever, it's now or never
You know what we want, you should give it to us
It's now or never, but there's no pressure (Baby)

And I keep picking petals
I'm afraid you don't love me anymore
'Cause a kid on the 'gram in a Black Dahlia tank
Says it ain't heavy metal
(And that's alright, that's alright)

I tried to do a head count but I cut off all the crusts
Said they liked it better curly (Yeah)
Then they gut me like an animal, animal
They said, "Hey, man"

You had that something special, it's now or never
Let's keep it quintessential, it's now or never
You know what we want, why not give it to us?
It's now or never, but there's no pressure (Baby)

So I keep picking petals (I keep picking petals)
I'm afraid you don't love me anymore (You don't love me anymore)
'Cause a kid on the 'gram in a Black Dahlia tank
Says it ain't heavy metal
Yeah, I keep picking petals (I keep picking petals)
Got my heart and my head all in the wars
'Cause some kid from A&R in a Patagonia
Says he don't really get it, no


So I keep picking petals
All I wanna know, do you love me anymore?
'Cause some kid on the 'gram said he used to be a fan
But this shit ain't heavy metal
(And that's alright)
And I keep picking petals
I'm afraid you don't love me anymore (You don't love me anymore)
'Cause a kid on the 'gram in a Black Dahlia tank
Says it ain't heavy metal
Yeah, I keep picking petals
I'm afraid you don't love me anymore (You don't love me anymore)
'Cause some kid on the 'gram said he used to be a fan
But this shit ain't heavy metal

If you ever start to wonder
Why all the rain and all the thunder
Follows her around
You better cut that girl loose
Most of time, everything's fine
But as soon as she starts to whine
If you have no patience
You better cut that girl loose

What are you, a coward?
Who are you helping?
You got the power
Then do it yourself, king
And do it for her
You better cut that girl loose, ah
Set her free, let her be
Leave her be (oh yes)

You don't love me anymore
Let's see how you like this song
See you walking out the door
Wonder why it took you so long
Ever since the day that I met you
Knew you were the girl of my dreams
But we could never be

Cut me open, take my heart
So we'll never be apart
Don't you let it go to waste

Such a sentimental love, in a cynical world
My feelings get the best of me (uh-huh, uh-huh)
I messed it up before, so I'm almost pretty sure
My karma got the best of me (uh-huh, uh-huh)

I'm bad at letting go
Won't you let me down easy?
I can't let you go, so

When you walk away
Cut me open, take my heart
So we'll never be apart
Don't you let it go to waste
When you walk away
I can feel it in my bones, you don't love me anymore
Make it worth all of the pain
When you walk away, yeah

I've been dreaming like a fool, in a nightmare of a world
It's bringing out the worst in me (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Shook me to the core, my optimism floored
My karma got the worst of me (uh-huh, uh-huh)

I'm bad at letting go
Won't you let me down easy?
I can't let you go, so

When you walk away
Cut me open, take my heart
So we'll never be apart
Don't you let it go to waste
When you walk away
I can feel it in my bones, you don't love me anymore
Make it worth all of the pain
When you walk away, yeah

I'm so bad at letting go
How do you make it look so easy?
I'm so bad at letting go
How do you make it look so easy?

Cut me open, take my heart
So we'll never be apart
Don't you let it go to waste
When you walk away
I can feel it in my bones, you don't love me anymore
Make it worth all of the pain
When you walk away

I'm so bad at letting go
How do you make it look so easy?
When you walk away
I'm so bad at letting go
How do you make it look so easy?
When you walk away

I listen for your footsteps coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps, but they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear, on my old front door
I don't hear it--does it mean you don't love me any more?

I hear the clock a'ticking on the mantle shelf
See the hands a'moving, but I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight, and why I'm by myself
I don't see you--does it mean you don't love me any more?

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so how I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
I'm sorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair
You were in a car crash, and you lost your hair
You said that you would be late, about an hour or two
I said that's alright, I'm waiting here, just waiting to hear from you
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, I'll hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, I'll hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

Well I hear my train coming
Hear my train coming

Well, I wait around the train station
Waiting for that train
Take me, take me, take me away
From this lonesome town
Lonesome town
Too bad you don't love me any more, girl
Too bad your people put me down
Hey, hey, hey

Tears burning me
Tears burning me in my eyes
Way down, way down in my soul
Burning me way down in my heart
Too bad you don't love me no more, girl
Too bad you and me have to part
Have to part
Well I hear my train coming
Hear my train coming
Well I hear my train coming
Hear my train coming

Today the world doesn't feel quite the same
Today I opened up my eyes but I didn't wake
Maybe I was dreaming and I never heard you say
You don't love me anymore
Me and you, were yesterday, ooh
This must be heartbreak, oh
This must be heartbreak

When will I be okay?
When will I be myself?
When will I move on and fall in love with someone else?
I'm hurting over and over again, I can't take it
Someone tell me when my heart will stop breaking

I ask the same old questions everyday
Where did I go wrong? Was there something I could say?
Did you ever love me? Or was I just a passing phase?
Seems like I was making plans while you made your great escape, ooh
This must be heartbreak, oh
This must be heartbreak
When will I be okay?
When will I be myself?
When will I move on and fall in love with someone else?
I'm hurting over and over again, I can't take it
Someone tell me when my heart will stop breaking
Someone tell me when my heart will stop breaking

This is heartbreak
This is heartbreak
This is heartbreak
Ooh-oh
This is heartbreak
This is heartbreak
This is heartbreak
Mm-mm

Today the world doesn't feel quite the same
Today I opened up my eyes but I didn't wake ooh


When will I be okay?
When will I be myself?
When will I move on and fall in love with someone else?
I'm hurting over and over again, I can't take it
Someone tell me when my heart will stop breaking
Someone tell me when my heart will stop breaking

Ye-e-ah, oh-oh!

I see this scene where you walk down the hallway
I try to stop you, but you don't wait
It's exactly what I was afraid of, you don't love me anymore
And I know the part where you say you're unfaithful
Sittin' at the kitchen table
In that moment in-between I love and fuckin' hate you
I'm not sure, not sure

Why that isn't stopping me
So come sweep me off my feet

'Cause I wanna give, give you all that I got
And I wanna believe we'll defy all the odds
And I hope you don't hurt me
But oh, if you do
It would be worth getting hurt by you

Everybody's got their own opinion
And I hate, but admit it
It's naive to think that you and I are somehow different
From anyone else
And I give myself, but only giving fractions
This is not what I imagined
Gotta put myself out on the line and see what happens
Before I give up

But that isn't stopping me
So come sweep me off my feet

'Cause I wanna give, give you all that I got
And I wanna believe we'll defy all the odds
And I hope you don't hurt me
But oh, if you do
It would be worth getting hurt by you

Oh, I could wonder
Will our love survive?
Oh, but what a waste of time
Whoa-oh

I wanna give, give you all that I got
And I wanna believe we'll defy all the odds
And I hope you don't hurt me
But oh, if you do
It would be worth getting hurt by you
Getting hurt by, by you-ou-ou
Getting hurt by, by you-ou-ou
By you-ou-ou
Oh, it would be worth getting hurt by you

hy does the sun go on shining?
Why does the sea rush to shore?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
Cause you don't love me any more.

Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do the stars glow above?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when I lost your love

I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything's the same as it was
I can't understand
No, I can't understand
How life goes on the way it does

Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when you said goodbye

Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when you said goodbye

Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but can't complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release
Oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
You should have listened

There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago

Oh, I'm screamin' out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or turned
Into your own
All 'cause you won't listen

Listen. I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but I will complete
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own, my own
I've been out on that open road
You can be my full-time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
You can be my full-time baby, hot or cold

Don't break me down (Don't break me down)
I've been traveling too long (I've been traveling too long)
I've been trying too hard (I've been trying too hard)
With one pretty song (With one pretty song)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life an art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it
Light 'til dark

Don't leave me now (Don't leave me now)
Don't say goodbye (Don't say goodbye)
Don't turn around (Don't turn around)
Leave me high and dry (Leave me high and dry)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes
All I've got to keep myself sane, baby
So I just ride, I just ride
Hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

Galaxies fall when I'm comin' down, nobody comes around
I can't do no right
Twenty stories high, holdin' up the sky
They wanna say goodbye, I just want better times
But I done got replaced
I'm on my own, and I'm tired
Dreams fall like nothing, dead slow, dead
Go on without plunging
I'm so numb, I'm so numb, have you ever been this low?
(Fuck, no)

I have realized I wanna rewind my whole life, it seems fine
I have realized that I am alone
$now Leopard wants to freeze and die
Winter breath, wishin' for death in the snow
Winter breath, wishin' for death in the snow
I am zero, anti-hero
Winter death, wishin' for breath—but I choke
Whisperin' help but no-one is listening
Goddammit, my piss, it stings
I'm planning on rebuilding history
Rebuild it blissfully, revealing misery



Ahh

Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time for somethin'
How was I to know?
How was I to notice?
I came rushing

We're on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday

There I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A.
Askin' how I managed to end up in this place
And I couldn't get away

We're on the borderline
Dangerously far and all forgiven
There's gonna be a fight
Gonna be a price to pay on Monday
(If you and I get comfortable)
We're on the borderline (On the borderline)
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time (Then I saw the time)
Watched it speedin' by like a train
Like a train

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Set it free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
If there's room, room for doubt
As within, as without ya'
Will I be so in love?
Gettin' closer, close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun
Here comes the sun

Gone a little far, gone a little far
This time with something
How could I have known?
How was I to know this dark emotion?
I said, "Come with me outside"
Need to clear my mind
This weight is crushing
Do you see the light, oh
Coming from their eyes? Oh no
And I couldn't get away

We're on the borderline (Ooh)
Gets me every time
These close encounters
Just to know I can (Just to know I can)
Once again I am alone

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Set it free, must be tough (I was fine without ya)
Will I be known and loved?
L.A. really messed me up
And it isn't cut and dry
Conversation, well I tried (I was fine without ya)
Will I be? Stay right here
Any closer, bad idea
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun (I was fine without ya)
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?

Is this thing on?
Reverse effect
Mmmm hm hm hm
Yeah, yeah, oh

Don't get it wrong, don't get it twisted
Don't mix it up, gotta get lifted
You know I'm young, you know I'm gifted
I'm on a roll, I'm on a mission, yeah
But I need your light, I need your light I need your guidance, yeah
Already high, I'll be alright, I wanna try it

Crushing the line, cutting the line, crossing the line
Bumps in the night got me, got me over here overstimulated
Crushing the line, cutting the line, crossing the line
Bumps in the night got me, got me over here over
Why you never stay for long? You always go so fast
Who's gonna hold my hand when I'm crashing

 Took it without looking now I'm looking up the side effects
Pill identifier says that I should be dying next
My regrets, oh my regrets

Over here overstimulated
I need your light, I need your light, I need your guidance
Anything twice, I'll be alright, I wanna try it
Aren't you the sweetest thing?
I almost can't believe why you still sleeping on me?
That's okay you can keep dreaming
I am alone, I am a misfit
I'm in my zone, no competition
I am the one, so you should listen
Don't fuck it up, don't wanna miss it
I am the light, I am the light, I am the highest, yes
You got me fried and I am the light and I am delighted
Crushing the line, cutting the line, crossing the line
Bumps in the night, got me, got me over here over
Why you never stay for long? You always go so fast
Who's gonna hold my hand when I'm crashing

Took it without looking now I'm looking up the side effects
Pill identifier says that I should be dying next
My regrets, oh my regrets

Over here overstimulated
Let's get one thing clear bitch, I am the greatest
You are not my peer, you are overrated

I'm on a roll, I'm on a mission, yeah
But I need your light, I need your light I need your guidance, yeah
Already high, I'll be alright, I wanna try it

Crushing the line, cutting the line, crossing the line
Bumps in the night got me, got me over here overstimulated

Get me out of here
Why would you do this to me?!
Someone give her some water


Better hold your
Breath (Breath)
Don't say a prayer for me
Leave me to rest (Leave me to rest)
Drink half an OE then fill it with OJ and drink up the rest (Drink up the rest)
I am alone
I, I, I, I want a place to call home (Place to call home)
Ayy
You're not alone
I weep a lot more than I like to show
Sick of givin' a fuck about the number of times somebody click a bunch of words in blue on top of a line
I never wanted to be a slave to vanity but now look at me I'ma piece of daddy I never wanted to be and I'm
Tryna find my way to the top of a mountain
But I cannot escape here alive
Maybe I'ma die all alone in the fountain
Although you cut me and left me to die
Blackmage
Tat on my face
Black balaclava it cover my face
Burn sage
All in this place
Cleansin' and washin' away all the hate
John Dee
Reincarnated
I'm Aleister Crowley on his worst of days
Stay away
All of you bitches that want me to slay you but can't take the pain
(I don't worship Satan I'm just sayin' that we get along)
When I was a lil jit I used to think that I was never gonna ever be shit (Gonna ever be shit)
Now I'm grown
And I still don't know which way I'm goin'
Life's a bitch, ayy
When I am gone (Gone)
Summon my soul
Tie me to the floor
Don't let me go (Go)
Do what you want
I'm one with my ghost
(Fuck! Fuck!)
I don't got a thing that I wouldn't leave to be 6 feet deep
Find me a top of a mountain and let me just conjure up something to help me

Watch your mouth, oh, oh, oh
Because your speech is slurred enough
That you just might swallow your tongue
I'm sure you would want to give up the ghost
With just a little more poise than that
Or was it God who chokes in these situations
Running late? Oh no, he called in
Or was it God who chokes in these situations
Running late? Oh no, he called in

 Hey fellas, have you heard the news?
You know that Annie's back in town
It won't take long, just watch and see
How the fellas lay their money down

Her style is new, but the face the same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes, a different smile
Like that of one who knows

Well, it's been ten years or maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue

Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rolling along
With the grace of the Lord above

People talking all around
About the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say
I know where their jive is at
One thing I do have on my mind
If you can clarify, please do
It's the way you call me by another guy's name
When I try to make love to you, yeah

I try to make love but it ain't no use
Give it to me, give it

[Guitar Solo]

Work so hard I couldn't unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times
However hard I tried

Heartbreaker; your time has come
Can't take your evil way
Go away, Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker!
Heartbreaker!
Heart!

Yes, lawd! Ha

[Chorus]
Growing up they used to tell me I was strange
I remember growing up they used to say that I was strange
That's cause I kept to myself and I would never say a thang
I remember growing up them niggas said that I was strange
That's cause I kept to myself while playing Kurt Cobain
I remember growing up them niggas said that I was strange
That's cause I kept to myself while playing Kurt Cobain

[Verse 1]
Tell me what you really know 'bout being so fuckin depressed
That you ain't left the house in months, assuming you're mentally done
I got a razor blade and cyanide to silence my insanity
The voices in my motherfuckin' head they keep on callin' me
No seriously, every time I wake up in the mother fuckin' morning I am lookin' for the exit
Exodus, the testament, to rectify supply but I would've never sufficed
I read a couple different words from the Bible and decided with a nigga believin' defeat is the purpose of livin'
Now let me give you my story the moment you give the feelin' I'm feelin' for real
Don't kill my angst
I can't be a motherfucker that's giving you positive records to make 'em think that they really got a chance
When it's all down hill
I can tell ya how it is
Fuck friends
When you needin' the people they disappear
I hear niggas talk, but what you really sayin'
The cadence at which I kill it
Debating if I'm the realest
Revealing that I'm a monster, molestin' the beat
I beseech you a piece and I promise it'll be-
Relatable to the point that's not debatable
Giving you agony, pain is evadable
Very important to show you I'm capable
Came with a bottle of anti-depressants
I'm praying the problem is that I'm not patient
I'm pacing and wondering
Talking to Christ
And I'm crying for help, I can't do it myself
I'm in love with the vice that's destroying my life
I don't have any character, ain't it embarrassing?
Give me some medicine, then I abuse it
Stuck in a rut and I don't give a fuck
If I live or I die to reside in the sky
What's the point?
I thought that I was supposed to peek
Interest, unrest, not bless, don't rest, don't test
No, I would never try to make a fuckin' fallacy
I guarantee you'll never hear a song about a fantasy
A vanity
Reality is the only place that I would ever really wanna live
In a fake ass world
You wanted money and women
Depending if it's a mean to an end
Now you're fed
Cause I wanna be alone
Refuse to waste time and I work at a pace at which the weak can't keep
I need a moment to gather the sickest energy sentimentally up and sedate it
I pray that I can make it
My heart keeps breakin'
Why do I feel vacant inside of me?
Verbal abuse and a case of anxiety
Lack of financial stability
This is the recipe for my soliloquy
Cynically sayin' a word to Jehovah
Supposed to be honest
Come pass the composure for closure
I'm poppin' a perc for the hurt, and I don’t think it working, so wait and I’ll master the pain

All them stupid niggas used to tell me I was strange
That's cause I kept to myself while playing Kurt Cobain
I remember growing up them niggas said that I was strange
That's cause I kept to myself while playing Kurt Cobain
Nigga, daym!

Look, I was alone
So isolated from people that I cannot see what is real
I was alone
So isolated from people but I cannot feel through the pill
I was alone
So isolated from people but I cannot see what is real
I was alone
So isolated from people but I cannot see what is real

I am alone, so isolated from people that I cannot see what is real
And I feel like I finally found the foundation of sympathy
Can I get some of your love with no judgin'?
The sound is improving the sentence
So pungent, disgusting
They think that we made it but that's an illusion
Created inside of our basement
Just me and my nigga
We workin', for certain
I hope we accomplish it
Never content with a case of complacency
Keepin' the cadence of mine
We combine in a kind of a law
For the few connoisseurs or the lyrically spiritual
I am attempting to take you to places of peace
And that was for your soul
If I'm out of control I can sew with a knee-riding temperament
Telling the truth I'm severely sensitive
Insecure memoirs of secrets inside of me
Asking why I wanna die
I'm detesting the lie and I'm blamin' it on the society
Simple to see that they prefer to indulge
I prefer being passive
Detering the falsehood
I'm taking the fault and I fall with the force of a heavyweight champion
Channeling all of his pain
I provide it the point
I'm ready to leave
I no longer deceive like the rest of them
Constantly wrestling with an idea then I start to imagine it
I'm aggravated, evading the question
The question I have is irrelevant
Seldomly different
Distant, depressed and I'm speaking
But no one is listening
I'll fade away and just cease to exist
I'm no longer determined
I know that I'm worthless
Lawd!

A winter’s day
In a deep and dark December
I am alone
Gazing from my window
To the streets below
On a freshly fallen, silent shroud of snow

[Refrain]
I am a rock
I am an island

[Verse 2]
I’ve built walls
A fortress, steep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship
Friendship causes pain
It’s laughter and it’s loving I disdain

I am a rock
I am an island
Don’t talk of love
Well, I’ve heard the word before
It’s sleeping in my memory
I won’t disturb the slumber
Of feelings that have died
If I never loved, I never would have cried

I am a rock
I am an island

I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room
Safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me

I am a rock
I am an island

And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries

Soak up the rag, spark up the the match
Light up the night and I never look back
I am the hunter, you are the monster
I am the entity, I am the haunter
Fight with no honor, fight with no honor
Bring me the lake, I won't choke on the water
I am the author, you are the paper
Rip you apart, leave the blood on the razor

Motherfucker I am the product
Of never feeling my feelings
I run up on em' in the middle of
The night and I kill em'
I drill a hole in the building
To fill the void I been missing
Can't tell me shit I don't listen
I'm burning up with the witches
Always been the same and I'll never change
Drift in the waves and I'm swept away
Catch me with the flames, I'ma decimate
And if I rest today I'll just accept my fate

This is how I feel, am I really here?
Dwell on every fear
There's no healing me hear me out
Show me who I was
Patiently faithfully chasing the sun
Drag me down, deep into the ground
Seep into the weakness, gotta get the secret out
I am alone inside my head
I can't be killed if I'm already dead
Heartless entity, double identity
Look at me, look at me
See what you did to me
Look at you, look at you
This is the end of you
Thought I was done
But bitch this is the interlude
I would be cautious, watch where you step
I am your conscience, I am your breath
I am the sovereign, never to rest
I will break down your will until nothing is left

I don't wanna live forever, I just wanna die a king
I don't wanna live forever, I just wanna die a king
I don't wanna live forever, I just wanna die a king
I don't wanna live forever, I just wanna die a king

Soak up the rag, spark up the match
Light up the night and I never look back
I am the hunter, you are the monster
I am the entity, I am the haunter
Fight with no honor, fight with no honor
Bring me the lake, I won't choke on the water
I am the author, you are the paper
Rip you apart, leave the blood on the razor

Motherfucker I am the product
Of never feeling my feelings
I run up on em' in the middle of
The night and I kill em'
I drill a hole in the building
To fill the void I been missing
Can't tell me shit I don't listen
I'm burning up with the witches
Always been the same and I'll never change
Drift in the waves and I'm swept away
Catch me with the flames, I'ma decimate
And if I rest today I'll just accept my fate

I don't wanna live forever, I just wanna die a king
I don't wanna live forever, I just wanna die a king
I don't wanna live forever, I just wanna die a king
I don't wanna live forever, I just wanna die a king

Sever her bonds, you take the wheel, I lost control, ayy
She did it all for some clarification that you never note, ayy
Give it a rest, best gesture the bastard could offer was the sacrifice of his, clarity
So where is the fairer few
Will never be free of this
So I pay the fucker repent
Trifle for the foolish will not give me bank
I fucked the face of the few I resent
I flee the light without doubt in my head

She did it all for some clarity, aye, aye
I pray I do not embarrass her
If I am alone, she is my God
And I am the devil resent from heaven
She did it all for some clarity, ayy (Yeah)
I pray I do not embarrass her (Yeah, yeah)
If I am alone, she is my God
And I am the devil resent from heaven (Yeah)
She did it all for some clarity (Ayy, ayy)
I pray I do not embarrass her (Ayy)
If I am alone, she is my God (Yeah)
And I am the devil resent from heaven (Ayy, ayy)

She did it all from some clarity (Yeah, yeah)
She did it all from some clarity (Yeah)
She did it all from some clarity (Yeah)
I pray I do not— (Ayy, ayy)
She did it all from some clarity (Ayy)
I pray I do not embarrass her (Ayy, yeah)
If I am alone, she is my God

It smells like you
The road that I walk on
I plug my earphone to my status
My true feelings lie beyond there

Baby why you far away
I can’t get used to you not being here
I feel like something is missing
I just want to be together with you always

When I realize we were only be able to meet inside this smartphone
You appeared before my eyes
Today too I feel the sadness of not able to see you
Contrary to my feelings time passes rapidly
Even if I feel insecure
I believe that my heart will not leave you
My heart will reach past beyond the wind
I am always under the same sky my baby

Everything is for you~
Everything is alright
Even if there is no answer
Everything is inside your smile

Truth
Even if we are apart
Our hearts are connected to each other
Forever with you

Flutter already
Flower petals shower
Sparkle already
İnside the sun
I am embracing you always
Inside my heart forever

Flutter already
Flower petals shower
Sparkle already
Under the sun forever just the two of us
It is alright since we are connected always

We live far away from each other
Today too I feel lonely
I want to see you
The night that I am alone I unnecessarily feel the lonelier
With distance my heart opens more
It feels unbearable when I hear your rumor
I become more frustrated with more time passes
The amount that over flows always
Oh girl your smile still remains here
Even if we are apart my feelings are
Still the same, we are always together
Everything is for you~
Everything is alright
Even if there is no answer
Everything is inside your smile

Truth
Even if we are apart
Our hearts are connected to each other
Forever with you

Flutter already
Flower petals shower
Sparkle already
İnside the sun
I am embracing you always
Inside my heart forever

Flutter already
Flower petals shower
Sparkle already
Under the sun forever just the two of us
It is alright since we are connected always

Even if we are far away
We are looking at the same sky
Even if something happens
If you are here I am not afraid anymore
I believe
Our love will lit for eternity
It will always stay beautiful as it is
It will always be like cherry blossom pedals

Everything is for you~
Everything is alright
Even if there is no answer
Everything is inside your smile

Truth
Even if we are apart
Our hearts are connected to each other
Forever with you

Flutter already
Flower petals shower
Sparkle already
İnside the sun
I am embracing you always
Inside my heart forever

Flutter already
Flower petals shower
Sparkle already
Under the sun forever just the two of us
It is alright since we are connected always

You are the victim
The victim of my love
I dangle up on rooftops
Before I push you off
I stand at the headlights
Looking for a corner where I can't be found
With a goddess in my right eye
Watching every lover on the battleground

You're hunting for love
Killing for pleasure
Lost in a concrete jungle
If I am alone
Make me a stranger
Lost in a concrete jungle (He-lay)

I'm an animal, animal
Hunting for an animal, animal
Hunting for love
Killing for pleasure
Lost in a concrete jungle (He-lay)

Isolation makes me hungry
Will you stay here till I sleep?
You'll return home in the morning
But you never really leave
I keep the memories alive
The weight upon my shoulders felt so divine
With a goddess in my right eye
Watching every step I take before I die

You're hunting for love
Killing for pleasure
Lost in a concrete jungle
If I am alone
Make me a stranger
Lost in a concrete jungle (He-lay)
I'm an animal, animal
Hunting for an animal, animal
Hunting for love
Killing for pleasure
Lost in a concrete jungle (He-lay)

I become an animal, animal
Hunting for an animal, animal

Let me become an animal
Let me become an animal
'Cause when you are an animal
You lose control

You're hunting for love
Killing for pleasure
Lost in a concrete jungle
If I am alone
You make me a stranger
Lost in a concrete jungle (He-lay)

I'm an animal, animal
Hunting for an animal, animal
I become an animal, animal
Hunting for an animal, animal
Hunting for love
Killing for pleasure
Lost in a concrete jungle (He-lay)

I'm an animal, animal
Hunting for an animal, animal
I become an animal, animal
Hunting for an animal, animal (Ho, ho)

On Jubilee street there was a girl named Bea
She had a history, but she had no past
When they shut her down the Russians moved in
Now I'm too scared, I'm too scared to even walk on past
She used to say:
All those good people down on Jubilee Street
They ought to practice what they preach
Here they ought to practice just what they preach
Those good people on Jubilee Street
And here I come up the hill
I’m pushing my own wheel of love
I got love in my tummy and a tiny little pain
And a ten ton catastrophe on a 60 pound chain
And I’m pushing my wheel of love on Jubilee Street

Ah
Look at me now

The problem was she had a little black book
And my name was written on every page
Well, a girl’s gotta make ends meet
Even down on Jubilee Street
I was out of place and time, and over the hill, and out of my mind
On Jubilee Street
I ought to practice what I preach
These days I go downtown in my tie and tails
I got a fetus on a leash
I am alone now, I am beyond recriminations
The curtains are shut, the furniture is gone

I’m transforming, I’m vibrating, I’m glowing
I’m flying, look at me now
I’m flying, look at me now

Here I am
Alone and I don't understand
Exactly how it all began
The dream just walked away
I'm holding on
When all but the passion's gone
And from the start
Maybe I was tryin' too hard
It's crazy coz it's breakin' my heart
Things can fall apart but I know
That I don't want you to go
And heroes die
When they ignore the cause inside
But they learn from what's left behind
And fight for something else
And so it goes
That we have both learned how to grow
And from the start
Maybe we were tryin' too hard
It's crazy coz it's breakin' our heart
Things can fall apart but I know
That I don't want you to go

Oh it's just too much
Takin' all the whole world all by myself
But it's not enough
Unless I stop trusting somebody else
Somebody else
And love again
[Instrumental Interlude]
And from the start
Maybe we were tryin' too hard
It's crazy coz it's breakin' our hearts
Things can fall apart but I know
That I don't want you to go, no
Maybe we were tryin' to hard
It's crazy coz it's breakin' our hearts
Things can fall apart but I know
That I don't want you to go
Oh no, don't want you to go

Pardon my soul (Pardon my soul)
Welcome to the end of the rope
Here I am alone, wrote a note? No
Going back, I am the one to atone
Throw them mothafuckers off the lifeboat
Water fill their lungs till they won't float
Sink to the floor till you can't sink no more (Sink to the floor)
God left me on read
What is so wrong with me that I can't get him to tell me the way?
Fuck faith like I'm Biggie Smalls till her walls get swole, I'm an animal a hand up on her mandible
Fuck faith, fuck faith, fuck faith, fuck!
I'ma pave my own way then I'll never give a bit of credit to a deity or nobody but me

 (I know what you're thinking, I know what you're thinking)
I know what you're thinking, I know what you're thinking
I know what you're thinking, I know what you're thinking about
I know what you're thinking, I know what you're thinking
I know what you're thinking, I know what you're thinking about
I want you to hate me, I want you to hate me
I want you to hate me half as much as I hate myself

I know what you're thinking, I know what you're thinking about

Hexada, never let up, I'ma get up

Do what thou wilt

Baby’s on the road
Tryin’ to find what’s golden
Never gonna hold her down
I’m chillin’ on the sofa
I don’t wanna yoga
I don’t want to life right now

And ooh, I see outside it's changing seasons
But I’m burning all my daylight sleepin’

I want you to know that I’m still tryin’
(Baby, be my guru)
You see through my bad, you know I have my moods
When I’m super low you pull me higher
(Baby, be my guru)
We’re miles apart, but not at heart, my guru

She called me from a train
Headed to a plane
Comin’ for a week or two
Gotta clean my act up
I don’t wanna act up
So I gotta find my groove

Good vibrations swirlin’ ‘round me
So why does changing hurt so badly

I want you to know that I’m still tryin’
(Baby, be my guru)
You see through my bad, you know I have my moods
When I’m super low you pull me higher
(Baby, be my guru)
We’re miles apart, but not at heart, my guru

Got some scruff goin’, gotta shave it
Get my diet up, no more eating bacon
Get a bathe in, bet it’d feel amazin’
Climb up from the cave I created in my basement

And even if I’m slow she’s patient with the pace I grow
(Oh you know she is)
And when I am alone she’s with me every place I go

I want you to know that I’m still tryin’
(Baby, be my guru)
You see through my bad, you know I have my moods
When I’m super low you pull me higher
(Baby, be my guru)
We’re miles apart, but not at heart, my guru


My hands are searching for you
My arms are outstretched towards you
I feel you on my fingertips
My tongue dances behind my lips, for you
This fire runs in through my being
Burning I'm not used to seeing you

I'm alive, I'm alive

I can feel you all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding on to what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healing

My hands float up above me
And you whisper you love me
And I begin to fade
Into our secret place
The music makes me sway
The angels singing say we are alone with you
I am alone and they are too with you

I'm alive, I'm alive

I can feel you all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding on to what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healing

And so I cry
The light is white
And I see you

I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
I can feel you all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding on to what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healing

Take my hand
I give it to you
Now you own me
All I am
You said you would never leave me
I believe you
I believe


I can feel you all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding on to what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healed

Here we go again
You outside party with your friends
And I'm at home alone again
I'm all alone inside my thoughts
Here we go again
You outside and you partying
Here I am alone again
Making these jams I usually drop
Here we go again
You outside party with your friends
And I'm at home alone again
I'm all alone inside my thoughts
Here we go again
You outside and you partying
Here I am alone again
Making these jams I usually drop

In the house I'm sitting
Usually overthinking
Tryna get my ticket
While you out there with them bitches
Which friends are with ya
So I can paint a picture
Of what you could be doing
Cause they motivate you different
But that's alright, that's okay
When you do things, do 'em your way
Don't listen to what they say
Cause you could be hurting me
Sent these words right your way
But I think, I could be late
There ain't nothing left to say
You done made all your mistakes
Messages have been sent
Waiting on your response
As much as I love being right
I'm hoping that I'm wrong
You sent me via text
I think that I fucked up
You fucked up on your text
That's how I know you're drunk
Once again
Thoughts alone, all again
I'm inside, alone again
You outside, wit your friends
I'm inside, alone again
You outside, wit your friends
Know that nigga, niggas there
Wondering what you do with him

Here we go again
You outside party with your friends
And I'm at home alone again
I'm all alone inside my thoughts
Here we go again
You outside and you partying
Here I am alone again
Making these jams I usually drop
She ask when are you dropping this winter
When relationships grow bigger
When the women start getting thicker
And the jackets need a zipper
That's when I'm that nigga
The one who's reminiscing
Each year is so different
But the feelings still familiar

Now you don't remember
Like I did back in December
When it was your birthday
But you was with that nigga
Ask if you would do me wrong
And you told me "never"
Said that word is bond
And this love is forever
And now I'm looking back
At that shit like whatever
You can have my bitch
Nigga gon' ahead and get her
If you can bag my bitch
Nigga gon' ahead and get her
As if I'm not aware
That a nigga could do better

Here we go again
You out there partying with friends
You probably out there going in
I'm all alone inside my thoughts
Here we go again
You outside partying with friends
I'm inside alone again
Making these jams I usually drop
Here we go again
You outside partying with friends
I'm inside looking so depressed
You outside laughing, hahaha
Here we go again
You out there partying with friends
I'm inside all alone again
I'm getting stuck inside the void

I was that nigga that was there for you
And that nigga didn't care for you
Life was being unfair to you
Nobody else had an ear for you
You ain't like how he do you
And he left you and ain't choose you
And he told you it ain't that serious
And that whole time he fooled you
Used to call my phone when he made you cry
Now you call his phone when I make you cry
Already knew he was your backup plan
So I don't know why I act so surprised
You been embarrassing me lately
Had me looking crazy
But I've been doing better, baby
Next time I see you I'm saying
Was hannin'
Was hannin' shawty, was hannin'
Was hannin' shawty, was hannin'
Was hannin' shawty, was hannin'
Was hannin'
Was hannin' shawty, was hannin'
Was hannin' shawty, was hannin'
Was hannin' shawty, was hannin'

[Verse 1]
I'm becoming less defined
As days go by
Fading away
And well you might say
I'm losing focus
Kind of drifting into the abstract
In terms of how I see myself

Sometimes I think I can see right through myself
Sometimes I think I can see right through myself
Sometimes I can see right through myself

[Verse 2]
Less concerned about fitting into the world
Your world, that is
Cause it doesn't really matter anymore
(No it doesn't really matter anymore)
No it doesn't really matter anymore
None of this really matters anymore

Yes I am alone
But then again I always was
As far back as I can tell
I think maybe it's because
Because you were never really real
To begin with
I just made you up
To hurt myself

I just made you up
To hurt myself, yeah
And I just made you up
To hurt myself
I just made you up
To hurt myself, yeah
And I just made you up
To hurt myself
And it worked
Yes it did!
There is no you
There is only me
There is no you
There is only me
There is no fucking you
There is only me
There is no fucking you
There is only me

Only
Only
Only
Only
Well the tiniest little dot caught my eye
And it turned out to be a scab
And I had this funny feeling
Like I just knew it's something bad
I just couldn't leave it alone
I kept picking at the scab
It was a doorway trying to seal itself shut
But I climbed through

Now I am somewhere I am not supposed to be
And I can see things I know I really shouldn't see
And now I know why, now, now, now I know why
Things aren't as pretty
On the inside

There is no you
There is only me
There is no you
There is only me
There is no fucking you
There is only me
There is no fucking you
There is only me

Only
Only
Only
Only
Only
Only
Only
Only

Prevalent melanin elephant bailin'
And carrying sedatives that'll give average lettermen callouses
Wrecking with savageness, catalyst
Battling rappers'll stagger right after the dagger is left in it
Cherish this caliber. (Release) Atticus
Shatter your algebra with calculus (give it up)
Damage your patterns I'm pounding you so fabulous (give it up)
Enough is enough is enough and I'm busting up outta this shell
An eruption that ruptures your structure to fuck with you (Release)
Up in ya gut, you a costumer
Huffing and puffing, discussing absolutely nothing, disgusting me
Plus infinity's up in me rushing your country percussion
No wonder you're struck in the boundaries
Wake up if you're lunging, I'm something, you're nothing (Release)
Now come see me grunting
I'm hunting for what emcees want
And I'm stomping my foot through your armies
They couldn't have stopped me with shotties
Oddity, why did he, why do these entire societies inside of societies
And survivors still remain alive (Release) emcees
Thriving to flow, opting to go
Five hundred and fifty-five syllables to go
Split em' with the subliminal intentional digital pro
Unlimited flows unriveted, inhibited, visited
Now you can't get rid of it like (Release) what is this
This magnificent, intimate, inner wit, in a minute finna be antonyms
In it with a gig, big fat heads like eggs Benedict
Pigs lick shit, rip with words and abysmal energy
It's time I (destroy the beast, release)

Inner breathlessness, outer restlessness
By the time I caught up to freedom I was out of breath
Grandma asked me what I'm running for
I guess I'm out for the same thing the sun is sunning for
What mothers birth their youngens for
And some say Jesus coming for
For all I know the earth is spinning slow
Suns at half mast cause masses ain't aglow
On bended knee, prostrate before an altered tree
I've made the forest suit me
Tables and chairs
Papers and prayers
Matter versus spirit
A metal ladder
A wooden cross
A plastic bottle of water
A mandala encased in glass
A spirit encased in flesh
Sound from shaped hollows
The thickest of mucus released from heightened passion
A man that cries in his sleep
A truth that has gone out of fashion
A mode of expression
A paint splattered wall
A carton of cigarettes
A bouquet of corpses
A dying forest
A nurtured garden
A privatized prison
A candle with a broken wick
A puddle that reflects the sun
A piece of paper with my name on it
I'm surrounded
I surrender
All
All that I am I have been
All I have been has been a long time coming
I am becoming all that I am
The spittle that surrounds the mouth-piece of the flute
Unheard, yet felt
A gathered wetness
A quiet moisture
Sound trapped in a bubble
Released into wind
Wind fellows and land merchants
We are history's detergent
Water soluble, light particles, articles of cleansing breath
Articles amending death
These words are not tools of communication
They are shards of metal
Dropped from eight story windows
They are waterfalls and gas leaks
Aged thoughts rolled in tobacco leaf
The tools of a trade
Barter's bard, barb of barters
Catch phrases and misunderstandings
But they are not what I feel when I am alone
Surrounded by everything and nothing
And there isn't a word or phrase to be caught
A verse to be recited
A mantra to fill my being in those moments
I am blankness, the contained center of an "O"
The pyramidic containment of an "A"
I stand in the middle of all that I have learned
All that I have memorized
All that I've known by heart
Unable to reach any of it
There is no sadness
There is no bliss
It is a forgotten memory
A memorable escape route that only is found by not looking
There, in the spine of the dictionary the words are worthless
They are a mere weight pressing against my thoughtlessness
But then, who else can speak of thoughtlessness with such confidence
Who else has learned to sling these ancient ideas
Like dead rats held by their tails
So as not to infect this newly oiled skin
I can think of nothing heavier than an airplane
I can think of no greater conglomerate of steel and metal
I can think of nothing less likely to fly
There are no wings more weighted
I too have felt a heaviness
The stare of man guessing at my being
Yes I am homeless
A homeless man making offerings to the after-future
Sculpting rubber tree forests out of worn tires and shoe soles
A nation unified in exhale
A cloud of smoke
A native pipe ceremony
All the gathered cigarette butts piled in heaps
Snow covered mountains
Lipsticks smeared and shriveled
Offerings to an afterworld
Tattoo guns and plastic wrappers
Broken zippers and dead eyed dolls
It's all overwhelming me, oak and elming me
I have seeded a forest of myself
Little books from tall trees
It matters not what this paper be made of
Give me notebooks made of human flesh
Dried on steel hooks and nooses
Make uses of use, uses of us
It's all overwhelming me, oak and elming me
I have seeded a forest of myself
Little books from tall trees
On bended knee
Prostrate before an altered tree
I've made the forest suit me
Tables and chairs
Papers and prayers
Matter vs. spirit. Through meditation
I program my heart to beat breakbeats and hum basslines on exhalation


The heaven-sent benevolent medicine man reverend
Peddling deliverance that resemble amphetamines to
The residents in the meadow of pestilence
Who developed a chemical dependence on pessimism, now
Is he is, or is he ain't
The most distinctive speaker seeping through your sleepy speakers
Yes he is, oh, yes indeed
So distinguished, so close some people think he's half [incomprehensible]
Ain't no secret, people, trust me
It's mostly hustling
That moves me upstream
But just focus on the unseen
Boasting and fussing
They both so unproductive
Suppose it go in my blood stream
Let me pose this question
Ask anybody, that's anybody
They'll tell you that the antibody to the petty
Potty mouth gossiping is
Success at something
To be the best at something
And not to stress the dumb shit
Cause you ain't missing nothing
You got to

Motivate, accelerate, never wait, know your weight, throw away hate
Grow and make weight of your older days
Elevate, concentrate, get your focus straight, aim, orchestrate fate
Just motivate, accelerate, never wait, show the way, no escape
Take hold and shift shape, live a longer day
Elevate, concentrate, get your focus straight, aim, orchestrate fate

Astrologists, colleges follow this through the metropolis
The dominant brown bomber, I'm in it, being prominent
Walking it mean, talking it, clean the scene, stalking it
Volcanic, got ya'll panicking, false canyon
And allways all day
Outlandish bandits be slandering what we mastering
Cause they can't catch us
They all pray for our downfall
Maybe one day, sike!
You never get no balance if you're crooked so play right, snake
I'm mongoosing on you, stormtrooping through your form
[Incomprehensible] bar none
Oncoming, onslaught, on one
Chopping you, I'll tomahawk, trauma hawk
Long running champ and rocking shit 'till I'm gone
You're a Tom Thumb and I'm King Kong Bundy
Strong thunder, all summer long, keep on coming
Dawn, dusk, night, morning
I'll bust tight poems
Raw, just mic zoning ya'll
With the right mode of motivation

Motivate, accelerate, never wait, know your weight, throw away hate
Grow and make weight of your older days
Elevate, concentrate, get your focus straight, aim, orchestrate faith
Just motivate, accelerate, never wait, show the way, no escape
Take hold and shift shape, live a longer day
Elevate, concentrate, get your focus straight, aim, orchestrate faith

I am alone in this place
Don’t you be fooled by these hands on me
It’s a fantasy, oh, but everything is too real
Is this a part of the game
A friendly exchange of blame, if you please
We talk of the things that we hate in ourselves as if we

We’ll change them
We’ll change them
We’ll change them
We’ll change them
Let’s see
How far it can take us before it forsakes us

It pleases you to say you’re sorry when you’re not
It’s a dangerous slip of the tongue
If it pleases you to see me struggling, I will
Talk of the things that I hate in myself as if I

I’ll change them
I’ll change them
I’ll change them
I’ll change them
Let’s try
How far can it take us before it forsakes us
How far can it take us before it forsakes us

Is this a part of the game
A friendly exchange of blame, if you please
It’s a fantasy, oh, but everything is too real

It pleases you to say you’re sorry when you’re not
It’s a dangerous slip of the tongue
If it pleases you to see me struggling, I will

If it pleases you to say you’re sorry, well I'm not
It’s a dangerous slip of the tongue
And if it pleases you to see me struggling, I will
Oh, I told you I was coming for you

I'll change you
I'll change you
I'll change you
I'll change you
Let's prove
How far it can take me before it forsakes me
How far it can take me before it forsakes me
How far it can take me before it forsakes me
How far it can take me before it forsakes me

I've been going out almost every night
I've been drinking everything I can get my hands on
I pretend I have fun
And do you remember the nights I called you up?
I was so fucked up, I forgot we were broken up
I still love you, you stupid fuck
But you don't look at me, you don't talk to me
And I know it's 'cause you're weak, baby
You feel guilty, it's pathetic, mm

And everyone says to me
"Missy, you're so strong"
But what if I don't wanna be?
And everyone says to me
"Missy, how do you stand?"
There's so much you don't see

I was getting swept into emptiness
I was taking time, I was practicing living with regret
Something you're so good at
At the end of the night, I am walking home
I pretend that I was wet, wanting them
No means please stop, I need to be alone

And everyone says to me
"Missy, you're so strong"
But what if I don't wanna be?
And everyone says to me
"Missy, how do you stand?"
There's so much you don't see
I push you down, I drink to drown, I am alone
I push you down, I drink to drown, I am alone
I push you down (Everyone gather 'round)
I drink to drown (I have the answer now)
I am alone (I have the answer now)
I push you down (Everyone gather 'round)
I drink to drown (I have the answer now)
I am alone (I have the answer now)

Four walls and a cauldron of Kalashnikoving
And our home is a trigger that I'm always pulling
At the border, at the, at the border
I'm at the border, at the, at the border
The short spears and the weak eternal monologuing
And our war is the crucible of all your longing
At the border, at the, at the border
I'm at the border, at the, at the border

I was there when the clamour got real
And I was there when your brow smashed the wall
It's like a riot with only two perps
The more I'm here, I'm making it worse
But does it feel like you're already dead? (Yes!)
And do you feel like your brain stopped delivering?
Yeah, break my finger, shoot out my black eyes
What does it matter if everyone dies?

 (Hey!) Hey Kemosabe, I'm alone
I am, I am alone
(Hey!) Hey Kemosabe, I'm alone
I am, I am alone
Hi-O Silver, away

So fast hence, take an arrow from your quiver or we're
Past tense, what's a trilobite to anyone?
I'm outta my depth, outta, outta my depth
I'm outta my depth, outta, outta my depth
My head reels and I'm crawling down the corridor
I can't see but I'm heaving like a holocaust
I'm reaching my phone, reaching, reaching my phone
I'm reaching my phone, reaching, reaching my phone

You wasn't there when I orphaned that boy (No!)
Your body was and the white of your rolling eye
I saw some terrible things on that night
I done a lot of bad things with my life
I put my fingers in thee
Hey, and I breeze past security
Nobody checking on all of my deeds
I need a checker for all of my deeds (Hey!)

 (Hey!) Hey Kemosabe, I'm alone
I am, I am alone
(Hey!) Hey Kemosabe, I'm alone
I am, I am alone

I am tired and uninspired
I am used batteries
I am talentless and stale
I am a book that's been read
And now sits on the shelf
I am a broken guitar string
I am useless, I am invisible
Every day I feel like I'm at war with the world
Some days I feel like I'm standing on the tallest mountain Screaming at the top of my lungs,
"Look at me! Please look at me!"
If loneliness ever needed a definition, it would be me
I see countless faces every day
But do they see me? No!
I am alone, I am invisible
All I want to do is help people like me
I want to hold you and kiss your scars and say,
"I swear to God it'll be okay
Not today, but one day
One day, you will wake up and smile for no damn reason"
But today, we can cry
Today, we can be invisible
Today, we can be invisible

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

 In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by
The flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

"Fools", said I, "You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words, like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said:
"The words of the prophets are
Written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence.”

Well I woke up to the sound of silence
The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains
And heart like the fourth of July
You swore and said
We are not
We are not shining stars
This I know
I never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows
To know you can never look back

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on, carry on

So I met up with some friends
At the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked
About how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives
But I'd like to think
I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know
When I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you want of me

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on, carry on

Woah
My head is on fire
But my legs are fine
After all they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door
Hold the phone
Show me how
No one's ever gonna stop us now

Cause we are
We are shining stars
We are invincible
We are who we are
On our darkest day
When we're miles away
So we'll come
We will find our way home

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on, carry on

No one's ever gonna stop us now

Can you turn the beat up?
A little louder
There you go

People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinkin' 'bout her all the time
I never seen somebody put together perfectly
What would I have to do to call you mine?
Someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes, or you can walk in blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you, don't you worry
Listen to me, I'ma set you free
He ain't gonna break your heart again
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend
I never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy

Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be
Free once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear-view
Let's leave it all in the rear-view, girl
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry

Mend a broken heart, girl, if you can
I don't expect you to be capable
You got the world right in your hands
That responsibility is unescapable
I promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live again
I'm havin' some trouble, can you give a hand?
It seems perfection really is so unattainable
Don't even say you 'bout to end it all
Your life precious, ain't no need to go and kill yourself
I'm not so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Who do you call to make it to the top?
And who do you call to make the shootin' stop?
And who do you call to give the coupe a wash?
After everything I did I think I'm still myself

Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be
Free once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear-view
Let's leave it all in the rear-view, girl
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry

Livin' my life in the rear view and I'm haunted by
My past and sometimes I just wanna die (Die)
I need to change my ways (Ways), mama, I'm gonna try (Try)
But that's a lie 'cause you heard me say that a thousand times
I said Lord please help me
'Cause I've been living unhealthy
And the life that I've been livin' Lord (Livin' Lord)
Can I really be forgiven for?

And I don't wanna let you go
I think about you now everywhere I roll
Somewhere down the road, I lost my soul
And I know 'cause it glitters doesn't mean it's gold
And I don't wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna let the truth be told
I don't wanna hurt nobody
But I'm about to lose my self control (Control)

And they ask me how I'm feelin'
I'm somewhere between Hendrix and Robin Williams
Hide behind the tears of a clown (Clown)
And the sound (Sound), of silence (Silence), it seems so loud (So loud)
Would you just look at me now
When I take a shot of Crown and wash this Percocet down
Played the victim for too long to justify my habits
Knowing everything I touch turns tragic (Tragic)

And I don't wanna let you go
I think about you now everywhere I roll
Somewhere down the road, I lost my soul
And I know 'cause the glitters doesn't mean it's gold
And I don't wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna let the truth be told
I don't wanna hurt nobody
But I'm about to lose my self (Struggle) control (Control)

I guess I'm narcissistic 'cause I'm tryin' to get it
Am I bein' selfish attemptin' to rid my life from the drama in it?
See it was harder comin' home than goin' in
Hard to understand that statement unless you came from where I've been
Why its difficult to do right but so easy to sin
Findin' peace in losin' to move on from the chaos of the win
That demon in the mirror is still the saint that he portrays
So the songs of tomorrow borrow sorrows from today

And I don't wanna let you go
I think about you now everywhere I roll
Somewhere down the road, I lost my soul
And I know 'cause it glitters doesn't mean it's gold
And I don't wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna let the truth be told
I don't wanna hurt nobody
But I'm about to lose my self control (Control)
And I don't wanna let you go
I think about you now everywhere I roll
Somewhere down the road, I lost my soul
And I know 'cause it glitters doesn't mean it's gold

This room's so quiet
I can hear the sound of silence
Right here in your arms
And I'm falling asleep to your heartbeat

It's just you and I
Shadows in the passing headlights
And I think for a moment
You won't let go of me

But suddenly that bright blue
Is glowing in this dark room
You turn away like I'm not here at all

Why don't you put that fucking phone down?
Darling, so we could be alone now
Can't you just be here when the lights go out
Why don't you ever put that phone down?
What could be so goddamn important
That it can't wait until the morning?
You got me right here with my clothes off now
Why don't you put that fucking phone down?

Yeah, the first thing you do
Is when I reach out my hand to touch you
Are you hiding something from me?
Cause you moved when I get close

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I hate that bright blue
It's glowing in this dark room
You turn away like I'm not here at all

Why don't you put that fucking phone down?
Darling, so we could be alone now
Can't you just be here when the lights go out
Why don't you ever put that phone down?
What could be so goddamn important
That it can't wait until the morning?
You got me right here with my clothes off now
Why don't you put that fucking phone down?

You're killing the moment
The window is closing
It's only supposed to be two of us
Put that phone down
Please, put that phone down

Now I'm feeling awkward
It's actually torture
You're making a fool of the both of us
Put that phone down
Please, put that phone down

Why don't you put that fucking phone down?
Darling, so we could be alone now
Can't you just be here when the lights go out
And just put that phone down?
What could be so goddamn important
That it can't wait until the morning?
You got me right here with my clothes off now
Why don't you put that fucking phone down?


Nobody here knocking at my door
The sound of silence I can’t take anymore
Nobody ringing my telephone now
Oh how I miss such a beautiful sound

And I don’t even know how I survive
I won’t make it to the shore without your light
No I don’t even know if I’m alive
Oh, oh, oh without you now
This is what it feels like
Oh, oh, oh
This is what it feels like

Nothing to hold but the memories and frames
Oh they remind me of the battle I face
Without your love, without you I drown
Somebody save me I’m going down

And I don’t even know how I survive
I won’t make it to the shore without your light
No I don’t even know if I’m alive
Oh, oh, oh without you now
This is what it feels like
Oh, oh, oh
This is what it feels like
And I don’t even know how I survive
I won’t make it down the road with one headlight
No I don’t even know if I’m alive
Oh, oh, oh without you now
This is what it feels like

I’ve got your dreams completely
I’ve got them locked away
That doesn’t mean I own you
Or control a hair of your sweet head

I won’t leave you to suffer
I won’t let them prevail
I know a trap door, short cut
Gate into the wilds of the free air

Lying here in the sweet sahara
Thousand miles to the nearest problem
I see you sleep, it’s amazingly sweet
I will keep you safe
I’ll be your pilot

It’s tough to become a grown up
Put it off while you can
I tell you that when
You land in the real world
It’s like quick sand

Grabbing for what is owed you
Crying for what is gone
Playing the game to
Look and feel and think
The same as the next child

Lying here in the sweet sahara
Thousand miles to the nearest problem
I see you sleep, it’s amazingly sweet
I will keep you safe
I’ll be your pilot

Lying here with a busted engine
Sun and sky and the sound of silence
I feel your presence
No, it doesn't make sense
You can sign me up
I’ll be your pilot

The technique depends mainly on arm and finger strength
Once you've that
Then the next step is to learn how to pierce stone
Well you might as well start practicing now
Do you-Do you-Do you-Do you
Do you know, mantis legends?
How it was it all started?
It was fighting off this blackbird
Although it was only a tenth of the bird's size
It was a very valiant insect
And that's why the technique needs a brave man
And a strong one who isn't afraid of odds

Welcome back to the temple of Hip Hop and Sword Kenpo
Lyrical rhyme nympho, b-boy Bob Digital
Diamond crystal ring, solid gold bone rituals
We be the humble, most calmest individuals
Hard to spot microdots, we Sasquatch
Stomp MCs, third eye Cyclops laser beam shots
Being fired once the father get raised up
We John Blaze up, abrasive heat from a phaser gun
Never left for a stun dunn, Atilla the Hun
Type Killa Park Hilla, eighteen wheeler
Macks in the truck lanes from the rugged grains of Shaolin soil
You red wolves be prowling
Howling over the shit that got the whole world bowing
We spoiled, one thousand swordsmen
One thousand recordings, one thousand Wu stores and
One thousand rap tours and global insurance
Not your everyday occurrence
My rhyme torments MCs with the fear of God
You'll be cursed like Farad and struck by the iron rod
Tchka-tchka-tchka-tchka-tchka-tchka-POW

Hell's Wind Staff, the wrath of Black Titans
Niggas battling, sword swinging
Cut-throat women, whirlwind given, save the children
Escape the poverty for living
Let live, die by the mic, shadow skill by night

Man-Mantis style isn't easy to learn
A mantis is small but powerful
With it's arms it can lift up many times it's own weight

On behalf of the Wu-Tang Clan I'll display the Hong Kong
Shaolin King Kong poems
Slaps niggas in half from Kwangtung
Ten Tigers scratch like Allah Math, the Hell's Wind Staff
Watch the Eight Diagram strike the diaphragm
Pierced lung minute funk tongue double-edged, sound the drum
Here I come as predicted
Holding the raw seal, all heads kneel
7th Degree black mic skill is ill, listen to the guns holler
Swallow the shell, East New York terrorist
Break fool to this, madness, crazy low-hand
Grabs the mic stand, smooth as water
Spat Seven Seas you've not yet mastered
Breathe and lungs wheeze, Earth kills
I'm wrecking MCs, blood spills, meadow, is round
The piercing sound of silence deafens ears
Fires fears, wood sharp eagle claw tears
Tree from bark, hard to maintain control
When you leaking, I stand with the strength of Jobe
And hold pressure that'll bust your head, while I'm teaching
Civilization, one having Knowledge
Wisdom Understanding, culture refinement
Not a savage in pursuit of happiness
Thunderous Mantis, all chant this


Creation creates a void
My hand held to the glare of this burnt impasse; yours
Necessarily on the other side of some sickly metaxis 
You're caught in stasis, matched with mine
Quantify time with meter and rhyme to calculate a way to prove that you are alive
Isolated, trapped between
A picture of you now stained on the street
Oh mother, teach me how to die
In your shadow, I saw to a distant future
Your life was only a nominal fee
Signing the sound of silence, signaling the end
They took your life, mother, as a pretense to pretend
The hand that feeds us sat you down
Covered my eyes, thrusted the styli
Retraced the timeline to call it suicide 

Will you wait for me?

Death was the chorus, our lives frames in refrain
Softly we sing notes better sung by our dead
I'd rather sleep and see you soon than die alone
In the waste of this nuclear catastrophe
We were made to create 
You spoke us out of nothing 
Out of the chaos we caused
Naked we came, shadows we leave

Salt of the Earth: preserve their songs
Light of world: burn out the shadows
Infinite echoes of stifled screams
The abyss you created will ever stare back into me 

Will you wait for me?

How I survived the massacre
I'll never understand
I fought the fight as strong and hard as any other man
Yet I returned as hero
While they returned as ghosts
A heavy burden on the hearts of those they love the most

Take me back to the place where I used to be
Before I lost a lifetime
Show me all of the love that I used to see
In the eyes of this lonely lover of mine
In the eyes of this lonely lover of mine

Now my reward is peace and quiet
Of both I'm never sure
Sound of silence scares me senseless ever since the war
I drink away my memories
Too vivid to be told
The hollow heart I carry now is no good for my soul

Take me back to the place where I used to be
Before I lived a lifetime
Show me all of the love that I used to see
In the eyes of this lonely lover of mine
In the eyes of this lonely lover of mine

Take me back to the place where I used to be
Before I lived a lifetime
Show me all of the love that I used to see
In the eyes of this lonely lover of mine
In the eyes of this lonely lover of mine
In the eyes of this lonely lover of mine

In the eyes of this lonely lover of mine

Billy's got a gun, he's on the run
Confusion in his mind, the blind leads the blind
Yeah, Billy's got a gun, he's going to shoot you down
He's got evil in his eyes, got a reason to despise
There's danger in the air

Can you feel it in the air?
(There's danger in the air)
Danger
(Such a strange emotion)
Can you feel it in the air?
(Oh, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Oh, he was locked inside a room without a door
His innocence he suffered for, in a world of black and white
They were wrong and he was right
Just looking for a clue, it's a nightmare come true
He's going underground to track that danger down
Oh, Billy, and why you got that gun?

Can you feel it in the air?
(There's danger in the air)
Danger
(Such a strange emotion)
Can you feel it in the air?
(Oh, yeah)

Never give him an even break
Getting caught is the chance you take
It could be your last mistake
(You could be so hopeless)
As a bird with a broken wing
Like a sheep in a lions den
Going to fall but you won't know when
(He's going to get you)
You hear footsteps in the night, see shadows on the wall
And the ghostly sound of silence, as the mist begins to fall
Then a scream rang out like thunder but the lightning was too late
As the rain came down on the crimson ground was the hand of fate
And a crowd of people gathered around but Billy couldn't wait

Can you feel it in the air?
(There's danger in the air)
Danger
(Such a strange emotion)
Can you feel it in the air?
(Oh, yeah)

 (Aah, you better run) Never give him an even break
(Better run) Getting caught is the chance you take
(You better run) It could be your last mistake
(Yeah, Billy's got a gun)
As a bird with a broken wing (Oh, Billy)
As a sheep in the lions den (Oh, Billy)
Going to fall but you won't know when
(Yeah, the heat is on, he's going to get you)

Where do the stars go when the sky falls down
Why does the sound of silence seem so loud
I'm out of my comfort zone
I stepped into the unknown
And every bone in my body says lay it all out, for you

It's deeper than the song I sing
I feel you belong to me
Never felt so right with so many thinking so wrong of me
Meanwhile you just stop for me
I swear you did it all for me
And you think I don't see the sacrifice
And girl that bothers me
Between the baby momma drama
And all of the pressure that's connected with me
I can't believe you had to left me
Lord knows I don't deserve a woman like you
I'm a lazy piece of shit
With a fucking short fuse
I fear that one day you will wake up and be fucking confuse
Like how the fuck did I ever even fuck with this dude
Insecurities, I'm venerable
I don't know how to be since I finally found my heart
I chose to put it on my sleeve
Where do the stars go when the sky falls down
Why does the sound of silence seem so loud
I'm out of my comfort zone
I stepped into the unknown
And every bone in my body says lay it all out, for you

You never knew when I was lonely
You never knew me at all
There's nothing holding me together
There is no one here to catch me when I fall

You never met me on the dance floor
Now I'm dancing on my own
Here comes the sunlight breaking through me
Nothing left here but the beating of my heart

Ooh-ooh, take me to the disco
Ooh-ooh, take me to the disco

I heard the music play forever
Or was it only in dreams?
Enter the sound of silence
All that remains is just the girl back at the start

Ooh-ooh, take me to the disco
Ooh-ooh, take me to the disco
Ooh-ooh, take me to the disco
Ooh-ooh, take me to the disco

Only the lonely could understand where I have been
Always on a journey inside myself
Remember me and what I used to be
I don't wanna be your enemy but I got to get away
I got to get away

Ooh-ooh, take me to the disco
Ooh-ooh, take me to the disco
Ooh-ooh, take me to the disco
Ooh-ooh, take me to the disco

The atom will implode
The fragile kingdom fall
The tremor becomes a quake
And there's a body in the lake

And as the two of us rebel
Damn you all to hell
I wonder is this all there is

Time will help you through
But it doesn't have the time
To give you all the answers
To the never-ending why

The sound of silence grows
As the spider's kiss is laid
The tumor becomes malign
But the kids are doing fine

And as the two of us rebel
And damn you all to hell
I wonder is this all there is

[Verse 1]
These machines are always running
Like the rivers and the clocks
And these wheels don’t get tired of turning
On and on and up and up
And everybody’s going somewhere
Something’s always going on
Barely blink, we might miss out
On so much laughter, so much fun
We want our names on all the lists
Don’t really mind if they’re misspelled
And if nobody takes a picture
We take pictures of ourselves

Look at us
Look how we shine
Look how we celebrate our time
The greenest grass
Right at our feet
Look how we skip from peak to peak

So we’re drifting downstream
Exposed but unseen
All covered in exclamation marks
Give me something tender
Something I remember
A touch or a beat, a wave of heat
That hits the heart

It’s hard to bear the sound of silence
So we get bored quite easily
Have you heard this song? I found it
Like it, like it, like me please
And we’ll fast-forward to the chorus
Join the choir, spread the words
I’ll take my finger off the trigger
Just take yours off the trigger first

Look at us
Look how we shine
Look how it eats up all our time

So we’re drifting downstream
Exposed but unseen
All covered in exclamation marks
Give me something tender
Something I remember
A touch, a beat, a wave of heat
That hits the heart
A touch, a beat, a wave of heat
That hits the heart
That hits the heart
Come hit my heart

On and on and on

So we’re drifting downstream
Exposed but unseen
All covered in exclamation marks
Give me something tender
Something I remember
Something I remember
A touch, a beat, a wave of heat
That hits the heart
A thought that sticks and flips the switch
And shakes me up
A little thing that I let in
A word that sparks
And hits my heart
Come hit my heart

Can you hear it? The sound of silence in the air
When you open your eyes, you can speak into mine with a stare
Do you see it? In the darkness, you can find me here
You could trace every shape of my soul with a vision so close

If I could hold this down
And to this moment, we stand by
You're the reason why
Ooh, yeah, yeah

Can you feel it? Every word is frozen in the air
Like a secret, the one that only you and I can share
If this is love, I don't ever wanna live this way
And if this is love, I don't wanna feel it without you

If I could hold this down
To this moment, we stand by
And I don't wanna spend another second wasting time
And you're the only reason why
If I could hold this down
And to this moment, we stand by
I don't wanna spend another second wasting time
And you're the only reason why

[Verse I]
The sound of silence vers' the sound of War
Echo death shock-renegade
Crooked cynic tyrant
Your ignorant bias is my Goliath
Starving alliance seeps under the skin
The seven deadly sins
That’s the seven elements of the malevolent
The relevance of
Graphic endeavors
Drastic measures took for defense
My secrets unfold codes of conduct, raid
Blade runner, intimidating
Figment in the minds of the malignant
Your opinion: not significant, bludgeon
Poetic potential draws dotted lines between hunter and hunted
Liquefied thoughts seep through the cracks in side-walks
Lieutenant cynic consist of anonymous all this seems famished
Vanished in gritty streets til' city seeks, sleep, head, rush
Scope, infra-red touched
Temple's the torment
Pressure point contact
Crush the dormant with missing links
Syncopate movement, Our trobbled blockade ends but I’m blemished in the blueprint
Behold of the hideous
Some assaulted by the anthems of the lesser
Concerned, I squinted through tinted pains of pressure
Transcend, backlash, jet black ink bleeds to breath abstract interpose passages
Database entries slip through the fingers, you're forgotten
A faceless figure shall put among an infinite citizens capital coward branded in the backbones of the stranded
Ese's hunger for upper handed plan strategy: strike force
Pays quicken upon asphalt light source sun burst beams
A portrait of pillage
Multiple put-downs paint burn marks on perception
Indulge indefinite challenging chapters never before have human eyes looked upon
The unbearable weight
Contaminate little thieves
Heaves, breath, the last gasp
And I last grasp, but trace through your trickery, pinpointed
Technique cast on the fresh but it's now thickly anointed, vicious cycle
Ya’ll spinnin if you tread before you think
The center of my web is pen and ink
It’s the merciless, masquerade merging separate flows of music's martyrs
Threw my flag into the ground and claimed your land for starving artists
The masquerade merging separate flows of music's martyrs
Threw my flag into the ground and claimed your land for starving artists

Dear Colleague
I am so very sorry that my son has made such an exhibition of himself with your daughter
It really does seem quite out of character
Although I have to admit it is quite funny
Of course he's really got into trouble with his supervisor
But I'm afraid he's only got himself to blame
It really...


All I see is little plastic soldiers with little plastic holsters
Spit on plastic cultures belittled by sarcastic vulture swarms
Warning I'd skip your stepping stones down by the sea shore
It's that scarlet welcome carpet that I fiend for
My dreams spore schemes each more malicious than the pre-ceding
Red skies bleeding acid this is best inspired by your doubt
All through flood fire and drowning all tied rapidy into humid winds
Lucid lens bend vigil spectrum's drippin' shades of rays, I prayed for days lacking discoloring
Bigots may seems to scare me I dissect voids my friend drawin' cranes with metal flanks 
Eye of the storm following scraping my backbone
I try to spring clones leaving em like tendrils, that require
More than a click-click five
While figments of malignant spine pleasuring quick to pigment puddles
Gathered in gutters
Type B-negative whirlpool
I swarm fool like you, poetically puncture
As still in dreams while empires fall apart
He a cyborg killing machine with wires in his heart
I'll never know of you
Emotion reads close encounters I run
The last classic example of a love of mic and sample
Trampled pride resurrected with ample improvement motor movement mandatory
Not a question of should I
But I passively consumed the role casted by masters of supreme sources
Crafted by supreme forces
Seemingly dream catcher
Aesop Rock computer Hacker!
See you lack a dispatch to request back up
Collapsing scaffold mad pole crusher russian robot recruits
We shoot starving artists 'de trops' and intrude
I am waterfall
I'm excluding inaudible slaughter calls
Venomous survey calibrating mics for lurkin'

Style messiah, Hot like a volcano with fire 

This young man is clearly a genetic throwback
He seems to be experiencing primeval urges and feelings which frankly
Unless we can terminate will contaminate others
And threaten entire structure of our society...

The crow and cackle of persistent innocence
Elated in argument, I'm empty and wondering
If you're only saying what I wanted you to say
'Cause you're only saying what I wanted you to say

So I'll just wait until our time
Slips through the cracks
Falls to the ground shattering
I'll just keep waiting for something to improve
Something to move ahead

Cause I'm only saying what you wanted me to say

The slow and steady sound of silence hunts us down
I'm empty and wondering what you sent me, what you're offering
'Cause you're only saying what I wanted you to say
Yeah, you're only saying what I wanted you to say

So I'll just wait until our time
Slips through the cracks
Falls to the ground shattering
I'll just keep waiting for something to improve
Something to move ahead

So I'll just wait until our time
Slips through the cracks
Falls to the ground shattering
I'll just keep waiting for something to improve
Something to move ahead

Cause I'm only saying what you wanted me to say

The cold comes
The rats in the walls break
The deadly sound of silence
As time decays
You try to name the unnamable
A whispererer in darkness
Our hound smells you
The haunter of the dark
Will come to take you to our realm
Your life, your books
March in front your closing eyes
Beyond the walls of sleep
Lovecraft in the realm of the dead
Obsessed with Necronomicon
The Arab's wicked dream
You found a path to Azathoth
And walked the Dagon's realm
Your friends were haunted too
Do you remember Charles?
Or haven't you heard
The music of Erich Zann
The call of Cthulhu we disguised
With notes and raving rhythms
To spread the seed of lurking fear
Into the heart of man
Lovecraft in the realm of the dead
Your time is out you saw too much
You used the silver key
You know too well that minds like yours
Can never rest in peace
You stared at the abyss
You'll never rest in peace
You'll never rest in peace

Returning to solace
So sweet like honeysuckle on the tongue
The sound of silence blesses my ears
Enveloping like the earth I will one day lie in
Metropolis is bad to wither the soul
Roaring concrete and steel washes you in blood
So let you point and laugh
Provincial ain't so bad
Take me back down to where I belong
To rust in rivers
I do not covet any man's life
I know my place all too well
One man's paradise is another man's living hell
To each their own
Generation's ago made this place my own
The roots are deep and strong
Carry them wherever I go

Never wanted your approval
Never wanted your acceptance
Never wanted to be anything but me
Never wanted to be anywhere but here
Carry me Southeast bound home

To speak in defense of our good name
Lay me to rest with my kin
In the ground of God's country

Lash out at any who would smear you with hate
Deify no one, never crawl ashamed
The past screams injustice on a Southern night wind
Whips manacles chains musket balls
A dark history never forgotten
Only misconception remains

Speak in defense of our good name
The blood of kin grants absolution
I'll join them soon enough in the ground of God's country

Never wanted your acceptance
Never wanted your approval
Never wanted to be anything but me
Never wanted to be anywhere but right here

Lady Liberty
Lift your lamp of hope a little higher
Burn that flame of freedom just a little brighter, please
For all the world to see and still believe

Oh, Lady Liberty
Show us how to stand and feel a little prouder
As the anthem plays let's sing
And raise our voices even louder
Since the real danger lies in the sound of silence

Lady Liberty
I see you rise above the crashing waves
Bearing with us to our darkest days
Like that terrible September
When we stopped and cried together
Remember?

Lady Liberty
Give me your tired and your poor
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore
Send these, the homeless, the tempest tossed to me, to me

So lift your lamp and lead us through the golden door
Tell the whole damn universe there’s room for all of us and more
Forever

Lady Liberty, my country 'tis of thee
Lady Liberty, for all the world to see
Please, Lady Liberty
     
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, an' I care what people think

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

My-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', "Wake up, you need to make money!," yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', "Wake up, you need to make money!," yeah
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', "Wake up, you need to make money!," yeah


Arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots
An' a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger
An' I ride it endlessly
She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
An' when she needs to shelter from reality
She takes a dip in my daydreams

My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
That little lady sittin' on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
As Arabella, oh
As Arabella

Just might’ve tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

Arabella's got a '70s head
But she's a modern lover
It's an exploration, she's made of outer space
An' her lips are like the galaxy's edge
An' her kiss the colour of a constellation
Fallin' into place

My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
That little lady sittin' on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
As Arabella, oh
As Arabella

Just might’ve tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

 (That's magic) In a cheetah print coat
(Just a slip) Underneath it, I hope
(Asking if) I can have one of those
(Organic) Cigarettes that she smokes
(Wraps her lips) 'Round a Mexican Coke
(Makes you wish) That you were the bottle
(Takes a sip) Of your soul, an' it sounds like

Just might’ve tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

Yeah, yeah, yeah
I take that one all the way up
I'm about to take off on these niggas, man
And I'm codeine dreaming
(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming)

I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

I'm in Uranus right now, I think I seen a demon
I thought I left you back there in the cell or am I dreamin'?
Say I ain't dealing witcha, dawg, I'm going a different way
I broke up with my redbone, I went the milky way
I'm ridin' in a Wraith, feeling like I'm outer space
Stars on my sunroof, Planet of the Apes
I couldn't wait until they released me, right back on the turf
I took off on you bustas, left you right on planet Earth
I feel like Jimmy Neutron, how I blast off on a verse
I know my son gon' like this song so I ain't finna curse
Know he gon' wanna explore the world so I'm gon' show him first
Say we just distinguished beings, baby, me and you diverse

I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming

'Bout to take off on you peons and go back to Mars
'Bout to leave these peons behind like the Jackson 4
Tried to moonwalk on the moon and had to wax the floors
Tried to put me in a box and then I crashed the Porsche, err!
'Bout to wake up in your biatch and go back and forth, yeah
Got her trapping out the the Fiat, she be back and forth, yeah
'Bout to put myself together, take it back apart, yeah
Got the codeine on my breath, it smell like caviar, yeah
Codeine dreams and they come true too
That's my spaceship, brp-brp!
My milky way got pregnant, she said it's for you-hoo
FaceTime Kodak with my new new, I left you 'cause he knew you
I'm wet dreaming 'bout Actavis, two new cups feel like new boobs
Tunechi

I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

'Bout to go to Saturn, heard they got the baddest species
You can hit me on my Galaxy, you tryna reach me
I went to Mars to get some Xanax bars to go to sleep
I'm in my Orange space shuttle flyin' two seats
I left Future in Pluto 'cause that boy was too geeked
End up playing Sudoku all the way in Mercury
I took too much of shrooms feel like I'm on Neptune
I'm with an alien, she show me what that neck do
And I'm a metamorphosis, you just a regular dude
You need a space suit to get up on this latitude
If she ain't foreign, then she boring, I need a Zorcon
You takin' morphine, homie, you a moron

I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling (Yeah)
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling (Yeah)

And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming

Yeah, haha, whoo, shit
Aight, guess what? I ain't comin' in yet
I'll come in a minute
Ayo, this is my love song, it goes like this

Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark (Fuckin' faggot!)
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is you're gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinnin', you're beginnin' to think women
Are swimmin' in pink linen again in the sink, then in
A couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42-car pile-up
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet, sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me outta this place, I'm outta place
I'm in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so

 ‘Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)
‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em "no" (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

In third grade, all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's Cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as Jude
Schemin' on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I've got no game, and every face looks the same
They've got no name, so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However, I do show some respect to few
This ecstasy's got me standin' next to you
Gettin' sentimental as fuck, spillin' guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like, "Yo, what the fuck we'd do?"
I gotta go, bitch, you know I got stuff to do
‘Cause if I get caught cheatin', then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run, these drugs are probably
Gonna catch up sooner or later, but fuck it, I'm on one
So let's enjoy, let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
'Til we walk around lookin' like some wind-up dolls
Shit's stickin' out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now, I'm gonna try to find some more

 ‘Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)
‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em "no" (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend?
Screw it! And what's a little bit of alcohol poisonin'?
And what's a little fight? Tomorrow, you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
‘Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin'
Even though you wake up feelin' like shit every mornin'
But you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still got a lotta growing up to do
I still got a whole lotta throwing up to spew
But when it's all said and done, I'll be forty
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch tellin' stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap
Babysittin' for Hailie while Hailie's out gettin' smashed

 ‘Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)
‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em "no" (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

 ‘Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)
‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em "no" (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

Drugs really got a hold of me
Really got a hold of me
These drugs really got a hold of me
They really got a hold of me
   
Darker than the ocean, deeper than the sea
You've got everything, you got what I need
Touch me, you're electric, babe
Move me, take me from this place
Movin' to the tempo, show me what it takes
Speeding up my heartbeat, playing in the flames

Kiss me, we're on fire, babe
Love me, take me to outer space
Kiss me, we're on fire, babe
Love me, take me to outer space

Covered in your water and I'm feeling like a summer breeze
Submitted under power and you brought me to my knees
Use me, you're electric, babe
Move me, take me all the way
Whisper in my ear, I'm the only one you're loving on
Take advantage of the moment, you're the only one that I want

Kiss me, we're on fire, babe
Love me, take me to outer space
Kiss me, we're on fire, babe
Love me, take me to outer space

Melting like ice on a summer day
Hold me like you mean it, take me far away
Bodies moving in, temperature rising
Take me to the top then watch me fall in

Kiss me (Kiss me), we're on fire, babe
Love me, take me to outer space
Kiss me, (we're on fire...)

Out of place, out of space and time, wide awake
Out of papers I am, not okay
I am out my mind
Outer space, that’s where I been goin'
To a place where, place where nobody knows
Floating at a pace where now you see me now and now you don’t

I do not feel the fear of fallin, I wanna fly
If it all goes well then I will
But what if I don’t?

Ill be right where I was before
But I’m not alone, you say take my hand
And we go (and we go), and we go (and we go)
And I hope that we don’t overdose
Cause we don’t (cause we don’t)
No we don’t (no we don't)
Ever know when we have had enough

Wait...

Now my thoughts so cloudy and my hearts so crowded with hate
I am so frustrated like my souls been taken away
Broken promise of everything that I thought you were
Thought you said this would never hurt, that’s what it did that is all

I do not feel the fear of falling
Thought I could fly
It didn’t go well but oh well
What do you know

I’m right back where I was before
But I’m not alone, you say take my hand
And we go (and we go), and we go (and we go)
And I hope that we don’t overdose
Cause we don’t (cause we don’t)
No we don’t (no we don't)
Ever know when we have had enough

I'm a be so cold, need some more
I’ve never felt these things before
I’m a feind for sure, please don't go
How could you not need me no more?

You're the only thing that I love
You’re the only thing that I want
You’re the only reason, the only reason

I do not feel the fear of fallin', I wanna fly
If it all goes well, then I will
But what if I don’t?

Ill be right where I was before
But I’m not alone
You're all that I know
]
At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along

And so you're back, from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey hey

It took all the strength I had, not to fall apart
Just tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free
Well now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, oh

Go on now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, I will survive

There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see
That's gon' make it hard to smile in the future
But through whatever you see
Through all the rain and the pain
You gotta keep your sense of humor
You gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit
Remember that!
Mmm, yeah, keep ya head up! Yeah

Our lifestyles be close-captioned, addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back in the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlers hardly think of culture
Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars, and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns waitin' to breathe
If you believe, then you can achieve: just look at me!
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me, protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious; just smile for me now!

Smile for me, won't you smile? (Smile for me now)
Just smile, smile for me (Smile)
(What you lookin' all sad for?
Nigga, you black, smile for me now)
Smile for me
(Nigga, you ain't got nothin' to be worried about)
Won't you smile? (No doubt, smile for me now)
Just smile (And the next generation)

Now, as I open up my story, with the blaze of your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly, up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone, but I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin' his tomorrows, and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories, and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my 9th grade, dealin' cocaine
Too many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
Over football chose to cook raw, wouldn't take but I did
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile; smile!

Smile for me, won't you smile?
Just smile, smile for me
Smile for me
Won't you smile? Just smile

Fuck the world, as we unloading witness furious speeds
Unanswered questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin'
Crooked thoughts laced with weed, learnin'
Duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin'
Inhalin' sherm smoke, visualize the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to diss us
Takin' pictures for the feds in desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us off, give us plenty centuries
Forgive my sins, since I entered many penitentiaries
The best revenge is "Fuck friends!" – we military minded soldiers
Bustin' shots blindly, tryin' to find Jehovah
To help me, somebody save me, lost and crazy
Scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
Embrace my words, make the world change
And still I smile, nigga

And now a moment of silence, let us pray
And as you journey into outerspace
May the angels help to lead the way
May the prayers that our families made
Shine up on your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac

Smile, smile for me
All you need to do is smile
Woooo smile for me
Come on, smile for me

Who are you to tell me
I'm not warm enough for summertime?
I know that I get beside myself
But you don't know me like the sun
You've never seen my horizon

If I was everything I never was
Drugs got me bubbly suddenly mumbling
Simile meant to be for you now
The futile go fishing for moon over roof top
A new style for praying to everything I ever loved
My black boy outer space looking like a rain child
But my body move like the sun
Go run til 'em rainbow we painted it 50 shades of grey
Stones across the lake, the house in the house
Deceptive carnations, our wedding we announced
On Sunday for the holy of it
Solely covet me and you, for you and I
Are blissfully tethered to simple redeeming
When sadness gets worse and we don't know why
Our city is bleeding for crimson
I don't protest, I just dance in my shadows
Hallow be thy empty
When my name don't sing, shallow waters
Under bridges don't forget 'bout me
Who are you to love me and not call me by my name?
I'm sunny, I'm sunny, just like you... Noname

Like the sun, like the sun
Who are you to tell me I can't love you
The way mothers love daughters?
The way Mary was closest to Joseph
And babies is close to The Father
You don't know me and love got a secret hand shake
And mad inside jokes
I could tell it’s knock knock when my heart beatbox
Use your inside vox
Who are you to tell me I don’t want you
The way flesh wants freedom
The way greed love need, the way kings need kingdoms
You don’t know what I know, what I’m capable of
What I slaved for and traded in favours
And gave up for you what I gave up for love

Who are you to tell me
I'm not warm enough for summertime?
I know that I get beside myself
But you don't know me like the sun
You've never seen my horizon

You like the flower that I won’t let die
Right before your petals start to wilt
I choose to give you one last try
Fill your vase up with water, refusin’ to neglect you
Like your father, so I promise that it won’t run dry
Good intentions 'cause I wanna see us both fly
But I often put me first and I been wonderin’ why
I know you probably think you’re blessed
To have a wonderful guy
And that’s the truth but at the same time a wonderful lie
Cause to me you’re a dime and I’m still a nickel
And you know niggas say that every coin got two sides
Well if you knew both minds not sure you’d like what you find
I made mistakes, I want to tell you but can’t make up my mind
As I’m writing this I see a red balloon in the sky
And to me that’s a sign tellin’ me that these lines
Were meant to be written, repentin’ in the form of a rhyme
I know the Lord’s a forgiver, hope he’ll forgive me in time

Who are you to tell me
I'm not warm enough for summertime?
I know that I get beside myself
But you don't know me like the sun
You've never seen my horizon

We, we don't have to worry 'bout nothing
'Cause we got the fire
And we're burning one hell of a something
They, they gonna see us from outer space
Outer space, light it up
Like we're the stars of the human race, human race

When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

We don't wanna leave
No, we just gonna be right now, right now
And what we see, is everybody's on the floor
Acting crazy, getting loco 'til the light's out
Music's on, I'm waking up
We start the fire, and we burn it up
And it's over now, we got the love
There's no secret now, no secret now

When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out

When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire
And we're gonna let it burn


And you didn't come here for me, let's talk about it'Cause if you would have came here for me, that would've been planned
You would've put me on
You ain't say, "Oh I'm coming this day, I'm coming that"

"It has come to our attention that a mysterious force is loose somewhere in outer space."
"The mysteries of creation are there."
"Up in the sky?" "Up in the sky."
"The moon and the planets are there
And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there
And therefore as we set sail, we ask God's blessing
On the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked."
"Prepared for lift off."

I Self Lord and Master shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters shall be captured by Kings
Through the storms of days after
Unto the Earth from the Sun through triple darkness to blast ya
With a force that can't be compared
To any firepower, for it's mindpower shared
The brainwave causes vessels to circulate
Like constellations reflect at night off the lake
Word to the Father and Mother Earth
Seeking everlasting life through this Hell for what it's worth
Look listen and observe
And watch another Cee Cipher pulling my peeps to the curb
Heed the words, it's like ghetto style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell, turning a desert to a well
Experience the best teacher
Thoughts will spray like street sweepers, little Daddy street preacher
Illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck plus the DJ you respect
The seven and a half combined, over the front line
The ten percenters promoting slander in the airtime
Bear in mind jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp blades, heavenly praise and dues are paid

Above the crowds, above the clouds
Where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual, above the clouds
Raining down, holding it down

I leave scientists mentally scarred, triple extra large
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars
Poison bars from the gods bust holes in your mirage
And catch a charge, shake 'em down like the riot squad
Invade your zone, ruin like ancient Rome
I span the universe and return to Earth to claim my throne
The maker, owner, plus soul controller
Ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
Stand like Collossus regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts at my life, so who to trust?
Who but us to supply ya with the fire
The burning truth, 150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notified families, we shed tears and mourn
But our hands are on the ammo 'cause the battle still on
Sound the horn, we come rumblin' through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch somethin'
When we die hard, they'll build a monument to honor us with
Humongous effect in the world, we could have conquered it

Above the crowds, above the clouds
Where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual, above the clouds
Raining down, holding it down
Above the crowds, above the clouds
Where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual, above the clouds
Raining down, holding it down

I found god
I found him in a lover
When his hair falls in his face
And his hands so cold they shake

I found the devil
I found him in a lover
And his lips like tangerines
In his color-coded speak

Now we're lost somewhere in outer space
In a hotel room where demons play
They run around beneath our feet
We roll around beneath these sheets

I've got a lover, a love like religion
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down

I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price
It's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down

I found a martyr
He told me that I'd never
With his educated eyes
And his head between my thighs

I found a savior
I don't think he remembers
Cause he's off to pay his crimes
And he's got no time for mine

Now we're lost somewhere in outer space
In a hotel room where demons play
They run around beneath our feet
We roll around beneath these sheets

I've got a lover, a love like religion
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down

I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price
It's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down
(Down, down, down, down...)

Every single night pray the sun will rise
Every single time make a compromise
Every single night pray the sun will rise, but
It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down

I've got a lover, a love like religion
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down

I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price
It's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down


Every single night pray the sun will rise
Every single time make a compromise
Every single night pray the sun will rise, but
It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down

It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down

Ooh, I'm not a psychic
But I see myself all over you (ooh)
Ooh, I'm sick on you, sick on you
But you're the medicine, too (ooh)

The gravity can't hold us, your hands are outer space
I can't make sense of nothing and words just get in the way
This couch is getting smaller, but it's my favorite place
Don't even ask the question, you know what I'm gonna say

I'm into it
Whatever trouble that you're thinking, I could get into it
I see a king-sized bed in the corner, we should get into it
All of the things, I wanna do to you is infinite
I mean, if you're into it, I'm into it

Ooh, I'm holding my, holding my breath
Until I'm turning blue (yeah, yeah)
Ooh, don't save me, don't save me, don't save me
I'll fall into you, fall into you

This couch is getting smaller, but it's my favorite place
Don't even ask the question, you know what I'm gonna say

I'm into it
Whatever trouble that you're thinking, I could get into it
I see a king-sized bed in the corner, we should get into it
All of the things, I wanna do to you is infinite
I mean, if you're into it, I'm into it

I'm into it, I'm into it
Whatever trouble that you're thinking
I could get into it (I'm into it)
I see a king-sized bed in the corner
We should get into it (I'm into it)
Enough of the conversation, baby, let's get into it (I'm into it)
I mean, if you're into it, I'm into it

The gravity can't hold us, your hands are outer space
I can't make sense of nothing, oh
This couch is getting smaller, but it's my favorite place
Don't even ask the question
You know what I'm gonna say (say baby)

I'm into it
Whatever trouble that you're thinking, I could get into it (thinking, I...)
I see a king-sized bed in the corner, we should get into it (into it, yeah)
All of the things I wanna do to you is infinite (everything is infinite)
I mean, if you're into it, I'm into it (if you're into it)
I'm into it, I'm into it

Okay
You say you never done this before
And that's cool and all
But I want you to try this with me
That's cool
Don't worry

Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me

I once used to dream of peace until I found you
Once upon a time baby
I once used to dream so sweet until I had a taste of you
Once upon a time baby
Reachin' out to outer space, dancin' to awesome sounds
This all new to you
I'm reachin' out to hold you close so I don't slip away
Explore a new approach, a whole new free I'd say

Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me

Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me

I know it's easy to imagine
But it's easier to just do
See, if you can't do what you imagine
Then what is imagination to you?
Just a waste of space in your brain
To take the place of hate or things all the same
Tell me your secrets, the things that make you tick
I like when you talk, because your voice is angelesque
Ay, I want to kiss you on your space below your navel at
The place that you keep neat, so moist, like a towelette
This will mark the day our minds and souls will connect
Let's not forget the sex, my heart you can collect, now, now
My heart you can collect, now, now
My heart you can collect, now, now
Have just one more cap, babe, babe, babe
Have just one more stem, babe

Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me

Pop it, ready, go
Let it, take, take, take, take over
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Get ready, let, let, it take you over
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Take it, just let it, take, take, you over
Get ready, let's go, let's go, hey

Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Enter galactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Enter galactic you and me
Enter galactic you and me

Soon after falling into a deeper psychedelic state
To escape the prison of our reality
Our hero becomes trapped in his own peaceful place
Which immediately becomes his sanctuary
A place filled with his wildest dreams
This is his new home

"If you’re feeling low, then give it a go! Try Lambert’s Sniffing Salts today"

You know when you're doing a song about a small town
You gotta start it with a cliché, you know what I'm sayin'?
Like...

Time moves a little slower here
The paint peels, 'cause the summers here are so severe
And we're nowhere near nowhere you would know of
Locals here ride, they show up just to show off
Old men take a load off, just to watch the day go by
Philosophising with their friends like they're Plato
They prophecise on the bench by the main road, right
They got advice; I’m like 'Ayo, if you say so guys'
But what do they know, Fox News got 'em lit
They’re shook, 'cause fundamentalist the new communist
Old girl with her shopping list clutch her handbag close
I’m like 'Damn, ma'am; Dan, this old bag has jokes'
'Cause I'm a gentleman, but then again most of us are
First name basis in the bank, the post-office, the bar
The grocer, the park, so lady, I ain’t tryna grab your pension
The old men on the bench hum

"Direct from the transistor radio in your lounge room; It’s the entertainment that the whole family can enjoy."
"Well, I say looking slick will do the trick, so try Barry’s Brylcreem today!"

Well, let's go, let's go
We're living in the days when everybody sayin'
"What a time to be alive"
But I'm feeling out of place like I live in outer space
'Cause it seems I'm stuck in time
It's like we ride through life
Right in the shadow of the cold war
It gets so quiet at night
Like martial law took a hold y'all, '55

Time moves a little slower here
A day feels like a week, a week it feels like it could go a year
And we're nowhere near nothing, man it's so true
I don't tell 'em where I'm from, I tell 'em where I'm close to
And I can go through an atlas and show you on a map but
You'd still look at me sideways and treat me like I'm backwards
But that's just fine, it so happens I'm
Happy living in a city that is trapped in time
While you're lined up in traffic I'm
Not panicked 'bout transit, I'm back in time
For a TV dinner and an early night
'Cause we get dressed to travel, got an early flight
Been doing laps of the earth while doing laps of the sun
Tryna put where I'm at on the map cause where I'm from
We never get a mention, but all that and then some
Once again, the old men on the bench hum

"And across the country, they came in waves. Thousands upon thousands of flying discs descending from the planet Mars."
"For the closest shave, try a Wilson’s razor today."

Well, let's go, let's go
We're living in the days when everybody sayin'
"What a time to be alive"
But I'm feeling out of place like I live in outer space
'Cause it seems I'm stuck in time
It's like we ride through life
Right in the shadow of the cold war
It gets so quiet at night
Like martial law took a hold y'all, '55

Where I go, where I go
This will always be home, no matter
Where I go, where I go
This will always be home, no matter
Where I go, where I go
This will always be home, no matter
Where I go, where I go
This will always be home

"If you can’t beat the summer heat, then what you need is a Wordell’s. Wordell Refrigerators - the cooler choice."
"The dieting revolution taking the world by storm."

Well, Montaigne, let's go
We're living in the days when everybody sayin'
"What a time to be alive"
But I'm feeling out of place like I live in outer space
'Cause it seems I'm stuck in time
It's like we ride through life
Right in the shadow of the cold war
It gets so quiet at night
Like martial law took a hold y'all, '55

You're full of something but it ain't love
And what we got, straight overdue
Go find somebody new

You can buy me diamond earrings and deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny
But I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye

I know you're lyin'
Cause your lips are movin'
Tell me, do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young, but I ain't stupid
Talking around in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass, you gave me sweet talk
Saying how I’m your number one
But I know you lie
Cause your lips are movin
Baby don't you know I'm done?

If your lips are movin, If your lips are movin

Hey baby don't you bring them tears
Cause it's too late, too late baby
You only love me when you're here
You're so two-faced, two-faced babe

You can buy me diamond earrings and deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny
But I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye

I know you're lyin'
Cause your lips are movin'
Tell me, do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young, but I ain't stupid

Talking around in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass, you gave me sweet talk
Saying how I’m your number one
But I know you lie
Cause your lips are movin
Baby don't you know I'm done?


You can stand beside the madness like a falling tear
You can hold onto the sadness like a souvenir
Or you can close your eyes and see your life
Like the air

You can tap into the strength you never knew you had
You can breathe into your faith no matter where you’re at
Just close your eyes and change your life
Like the air

Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
Rise

The earth can pull you down with all its gravity
And the measure of your worth is sometimes hard to see
So just hold on, when the night is done
Like the sun

Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
Rise

So even when your bones feel like weights
And it’s hard to lift the smile on your perfect face
You can still find a peaceful place
Close your eyes until you're floating up in outer space
It’ll be alright, they’re just jealous of your highs
So they can knock you down, but

Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
Rise

Show me to a higher place
Take me to outer space
I want you to be my friend
We'll make it till the world ends

Show me to a higher place
Take me to outer space
I want you to be my friend
We'll make it till the world ends

Don't give me love governed by life
That makes it hard, these worldly heights
I wanna know that the universe
Can never stop, can never hurt

I want a love that will last
After this world is our past
A love that no time could erase
A love in a higher place

Show me to a higher place
Take me to outer space
I want you to be my friend
We'll make it till the world ends

Show me to a higher place
Take me to outer space
I want you to be my friend
We'll make it till the world ends

Don't sell me short
I'm not conditional
I wanna love
Beyond what we all know

I want a love that will last
After this world is our past
A love that no time could erase
A love in a higher place

Show me to a higher place
Take me to outer space
I want you to be my friend
We'll make it till the world ends

Show me to a higher place
Take me to outer space
I want you to be my friend
We'll make it till the world ends


Dark mascara dripping down my face
Only fools could ever feel this way
Send my message into outer space
Wonder if it's gonna float your way

I can't compete with the stars in the sky
I'm invisible, invisible
I open the window to clear out my mind
But it's difficult, so difficult

Houston, I know there's a problem here
Must be a hole in the atmosphere
Baby, I wanna be closer to love

Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon
Moon

Last night I was in your arms so strong (It felt so good)
One small step and, baby, you were gone
Now there's meaning in the saddest songs (I just wanna cry)
All I do is cry and sing along (And cry, and cry...)

Drinking alone in my party dress
Would you come back if I looked my best?
Put on a smile and I say to myself (I said it again)

Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon
Moon
Moon
Moon

I can't compete with the stars in the sky
I'm invisible, invisible
I open the window to clear up my mind
But it's difficult (why is it so difficult?), so difficult
Château Marouatte
Il m'amène au lieu du chevalier cet hivers
Cinq, quatre, trois, deux, un

Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon
Moon
Moon
Moon

Oh no, you don't dare
Girl, girl, girl, I'm warning you!
No! I think I have a crush. I can't
I think I'm falling for him
Oh no
Why not?

Women have been making bad choices
Since the beginning of time
Are you gonna be another one of mine? Ohh

Used to think you were from outer space
Who's that bright-eyed guy in your place?
You're kinda cute, when you're not so shy. Ohh

But I've been here before
Have I come back for more?
Another chapter in the history of wrong guys
You used to be so "eh"
A limp lackluster bore
But now you're changing into something I just can't ignore

Charlie, honestly
I've been hurt like this before
Is there really more to you
Than what I always thought
How can you surprise me anymore?
Ohh. Ohh. Ohhhhhh

He's got a girlfriend, you flake!
Why are they only nice when they're unavailable?!

Don't wanna be another star-crossed lover
We all know how that ends
I'm better off without him
We're better off as friends. Ohh

But I've been here before
Have I come back for more?
Another chapter in the history of wrong guys
Yesterday no spark
No heart aching allure
But today I'm feeling something I just can't ignore

Charlie, honestly
I've been hurt like this before
Ohh. Ohh. Ohhhhhh

The history of wrong guys:
Chapter One - He's a bum
Two - He's not into you
Three - He's a sleaze
Four - Loves the girl next door
Five - Loves the boy next door
Six - Don't love you no more
Makes you insecure
Makes you so unsure
Is so immature
Loves his mother more
Or
Has a girlfriend named Nicola
...Ah

Charlie, honestly
I've been hurt like this before-oh-ohh
I can see there's more to you
Than what I always thought
But I won't be burned anymore. Ohh. Ohh. Ohhhhhh

Hey. Where you off to?

I've been executized

I was there on the day truth died
Blood on my hands throw 'em up in the sky
I was the number one sinner, no less
My life was a lie, and my wish was a death
I fell in love with the ways of the world
Money, the fame, the booze, the girls
But I couldn't stay faithful, if I've tried
I turned in to a devil, you could see it in my eyes
I blacked out, told everything I ever did
I couldn't take all the lies I was living with
I broke your heart, woke up the next day
My bags outside, yelling, "Get the hell away!
You're not a husband, not a father, just a pig
And you can't never change all the things that you did!"
That's when I knew it, it wouldn't last
You never get away, when you're running from the past

I will fly into outer space
I float away, but you're my gravity
I will die to love another day
We rise again and lose our gravity

I'm a broken man, I'm full of sin
I'm sick of all this hell that I'm living in
And I can't escape it, this is how it feels
When you try to numb the pain with a thousand pills
You tore me down, wished that I was dead
Said you wanna sleep alone in another bed
But when I push away, you only pull me closer
It's only over when we both wanna say it's over
I gotta change this is not who I am
I wanna start over wanna try this again
You're everything I need, everything I'm not
So pull the trigger, give me one more shot

I will fly into outer space
I float away, but you're my gravity
I will die to love another day
We rise again and lose our gravity

You love me, you hate me, you kiss me, you break me
You lifted me up just to watch as you broke me
You promised me, looked me straight in the eyes
No matter what you say, I don't know truth from the lies
I helped you up, like I always do
I forgave you for your sins and I carried you through them
No matter how hard we fought, we always knew
You will bleed for me, and I will bleed for you

Fly into outer space
I float away, but you're my gravity
Die to love another day
We rise again and lose our gravity

I will fly into outer space
I float away, but you're my gravity
I will die to love another day
We rise again and lose our gravity
I will fly into outer space
I float away, but you're my gravity
I will die to love another day
We rise again and lose our gravity

Baby, we can float away

How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
'Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself, "Why do you worry?"
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

I think I killed e'rybody
In the game last year, man, fuck it, I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams
At a strip club, mmm-mmm, fuck it, I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
Yeah, it's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even notice I was winning

And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

You say I'm old news, well who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah, it's whatever
You know, feeling good, living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got ten years to go, huh?

And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

Three in the morning, still going down

Woah, woah, ehh

I left my girl back home
I don't love her no more
And she'll never fucking know that
These fucking eyes that I'm staring at
Let me see that ass
Look at all this cash
And I emptied out my cards too
Now I'm fucking leaning on that

Bring your love, baby, I could bring my shame
Bring the drugs, baby, I could bring my pain
I got my heart right here
I got my scars right here
Bring the cups, baby, I could bring the drank
Bring your body, baby, I could bring you fame
And that's my motherfucking words too
Just let me motherfucking love you

Listen, ma, I'll give you all I got
Get me off of this, I need confidence in myself (Yeah, yeah, yeah, ohh, yeah)
Ohh, listen, ma, I'll give you all of me
Give me all of it, I need all of it to myself (Woah, woah)
So tell me you love me
(Only for tonight, only for the night)
Even though you don't love me (Ohh, ohh)
Just tell me you love me
(I'll give you what I need, I'll give you all of me)
Even though you don't love me (Ohh, ohh) (yeah, yeah) (yeah, yeah)

Let me see you dance
I love to watch you dance
Take you down another level
And get you dancing with the Devil
Take a shot of this
But I'm warning you
I'm on that shit that you can't smell, baby
So, put down your perfume

Bring your love, baby, I could bring my shame
Bring the drugs, baby, I could bring my pain
Oh, I got my heart right here
Oh, I got my scars right here
Bring the cups, baby, I could bring the drank
Bring your body, baby, I could bring you fame
And that's my motherfucking words too, ayy
So let me motherfucking love you

Listen, ma, I'll give you all I got
Get me off of this (off of this), I need confidence (confidence) in myself (Ooh, eh, ehh)
Listen, ma, I'll give you all of me (Ooh)
Give me all of it, I need all of it to myself (I need all of it)
So tell me you love me, yeah

Even though you don't love me (Ohh, ohh)
Just tell me you love me
(I'll give you what I need, I'll give you all of me)
Even though you don't love me (Ohh, ohh)
Ohh

(I need you back, I need you back)
(Mhmmm, even if you don't love me back)

If life was a movie
I’d be your favourite actor
You’d be my favourite scene
You’d be my favourite chapter

My eyes never left the screen
Since I saw you, the one that I been after
I could watch you over and over
Filled my life with laughter
And if life was a book
You’d be my favourite author
I’d read your words night and day
And I would never bother to leave
You're the only book I would read

And If life was a song
This would be my favourite song
I wrote this when you're gone
Wonder when you're coming home
Or if you're coming home
You been gone hella long
And I'd been all alone

You used to be comfort zone
Used to be my one
And only one I wanna hold
Remember you would wanna hold me
Falling in my arms
So I fell for you
Foolish move that I fell for you

'Cause baby, yeah, I need you
I would never leave you
Wonder how you left me
You left me feeling empty

And I can’t lie, you’re see through
I cannot believe you
Even though you did me wrong
For some reason I need you

And I can’t lie, I miss you
I forgot them issues
How could you forget me
When I couldn't forget you

And baby, yeah, your special
I could not forget you
Even when I tried baby
I could not forget you

I can’t lie, I miss you
I forgot them issues
How could you forget me
When I couldn't forget you

And baby, yeah, your special
I could not forget you
Even when I tried baby
I could not forget you

Girl, I want you

Girl, I love you
Even if you don’t love me back (don’t love me back)

Girl, I want you

Girl, I'm gon' love you
Even if you don’t love me back (don’t love me back)

Foolish move that I fell for you

Tell me what you're waiting for

I just wanna hold you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
I just wanna love you
Just wanna hold you, never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
What you waiting for?

It feels like I can see the past in your eyes
I know the future has been passing you by
These other niggas, they just passing your time
They don't know how to ride the tidal waves
That crash in your thighs
But I got the dream, and if you believe
Then I can take you somewhere that is pristine
I'm keeping it clean, my title is mean
They boxin' us in but we broke out the seams
Don't make me a fiend, I know what I want
I'm working to get everything that I need
But I got a plan for you
I'm taking a stand for you, I care for you

What's your motive with me, baby?
'Cause I don't trust nobody lately
I twist and turn, moving just like a serpent
New times are coming just like a virgin
Get you all outta my head, 'cause lately I'm better off dead
I say this all out of respect, sometimes, I want nothing with you
Wearing your love like medallions
'Cause I know thousand men want ya, wants the menages
Fucking, riding shotgun, slap your buns
Melting, fading, under stars and the sun
85, 90, gon' bust out the gun
Know they sent me from the neck of the woods
Change my name, state so they never could

Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love you
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold you
Tell me what you're waiting for, hun
I just wanna love you
Just wanna hold you, never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for, hun
What you waiting for?

I need a friend (I need a friend)
And you need a home (you need a home)
I love when you come (I love when you coming)
I still feel alone
You make it warm in my bed, butterflies in my head
Sunrise, let it set
But you don't love me like you say you do
White lies hold the hidden truth
You keep leaving when I need you most
It's true what they say about
Love had and love lost, here you are and now you're gone
I'm left alone in the same bed, I wake up in a cold sweat

Please don't make me wait long
I just wanna be your main one
Your main, your main one, mm-mm
See, I don't want nobody, but you. mm-mm
See, I don't want nobody, but you-u-u, mm-mm
I spent the day by my lonesome
Who do you call when there's no one?
No one ever did what you did for me and did to me
My bed is cold and indented where you used to sleep
Tell me what you're waiting for, shit
Tell me what I'm here for

Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love you
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
I just wanna love you
Just wanna hold you, never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
What you waiting for?

Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sun rise
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)

Listen to the wind blow
Down comes the night
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence
Damn the dark, damn the light

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)


 (Chain, keep us together) Run in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Runnin' in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Runnin' in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Run in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Run in the shadow

You don't love me anymore
Let's see how you like this song
See you walking out that door
Wonder why it took you so long
Ever since the day that I met you
I knew you were the girl of my dreams
But we could never be
You don't love me anymore
Let's see how you like this song

We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up
We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up

You don't love me anymore
Let's see how you like this song
You need someone you adore
Find a place where you might belong
Ever since the day that I met you
My world's been spinnin' out of control
I just need you to hold

We knew it'd come around
This thing called love comes crashing down, ahh
Pieces all on the ground
What once was lost cannot be found, ahh
We knew it'd come around (We find love)
This thing called love comes crashing down, ahh (We get up)
Pieces all on the ground (Then we fall down)
What once was lost cannot be found, ahh (We give up)
We knew it'd come around (We find love)
This thing called love comes crashing down, ahh (We get up)
Pieces all on the ground (Then we fall down)
What once was lost cannot be found, ahh (We give up)
Heaven help us, heaven help us, yeah
We're on our own

We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up
We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up
We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up
We find love, yeah, we get up
We fall down, we give up

Oh

Breakfast is cold, as cold as our bed
I'm watching you choke down the words that you said
I watch you devour, mistake me for bread
Well boy, is you fed? Or are you misled?
I gave you the messiest head
You give me the messiest head
Oh, you're turnin' red
'Cause I'm tryna give the impression that I get the message you wish I was dead

See you 'bouta break a sweat (I, I, I)
I won't let us finish yet (I, I, I)
Please don't take this as a threat (I, I, I)
All I'm sayin' is if you don't love me no more, then

Lie, lie
Lie, lie

I heard what you said (What she say?)
You talk about your head game (Oh)
I know that it's fire flame (Fire)
Your mouth make a hurricane (Splash)
You notice that we in love (Love)
That's something we cannot change (No)
It's the plans we should arrange (Plans)
Treat her right and she won't complain (Yeah)
Bring back the title (Bring it back)
She tall like the Eiffel (Yeah)
Got no one to lie to (No)
There's no need to lie no more (Ayy)
Bring me a trial (Bring)
Every move's vital (Ooh)
What you gon' die for
When everything you told lies? Alright
Lie, lie
Lie, lie
Lie, lie
Lie, lie

Tell me that you love me, when you know you don't love me
But I guess, I guess, I guess it's all good
You can play the game, I'ma still do my thing
Ain't no better way for it to be put
When you fuck them other girls
I bet they be wondering why you always call my name
You think I'm gonna wait around, I ain't got all day

You don't need another lover
Don't you let it go
I already got it covered
Let the others know

If you want it, let's do it

Bedroom in the bank, baby we safe

Talking 'bout leaving and you ain't gone yet
And if you leave, leave correct
And I'mma send a jet to pick up the next
And if you leave, you leaving the best
So you will have to settle for less
And I am no Elliott Ness

Why does the sun go on shining?
Why does the sea rush to shore?
Don’t they know it’s The End of the World
Cause you don’t love me any more

Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do the stars glow above?
Don’t they know it’s The End of the World
It ended when I lost your love

I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything’s the same as it was
I can’t understand, no, I can’t understand
How life goes on the way it does

Why does my heart go on beating
Why do these eyes of mine cry
Don’t they know it’s the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye

Why does my heart go on beating
Why do these eyes of mine cry
Don’t they know it’s the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye

2 A.M. again and I'm thinkin' 'bout

Stuck in time, do it again

All you ever say is, "Come and see me for once

Why you never come to me, no?"

This my time, it's your turn

I know it burns to be another
One of your girls on the side like that
I know your kind, how you lie like that
I know you're mine when you bite it like that
I know you're mine when you put it like that
Guess you was right when you put it like that

To waste no time on you
Got to move on cause you got me fucked up
I am confused from this point on trust nobody, yeah

[Intro: Luke]
Cut me open, take my heart
So we'll never be apart
Don't you let it go to waste

Such a sentimental love, in a cynical world
My feelings get the best of me (uh-huh, uh-huh)
I messed it up before, so I'm almost pretty sure
My karma got the best of me (uh-huh, uh-huh)

I'm bad at letting go
Won't you let me down easy?
I can't let you go, so

When you walk away
Cut me open, take my heart
So we'll never be apart
Don't you let it go to waste
When you walk away
I can feel it in my bones, you don't love me anymore
Make it worth all of the pain
When you walk away, yeah

I've been dreaming like a fool, in a nightmare of a world
It's bringing out the worst in me (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Shook me to the core, my optimism floored
My karma got the worst of me (uh-huh, uh-huh)

I'm bad at letting go
Won't you let me down easy?
I can't let you go, so

When you walk away
Cut me open, take my heart

Don't you let it go to waste
When you walk away
I can feel it in my bones, you don't love me anymore
Make it worth all of the pain
When you walk away, yeah

I'm so bad at letting go
How do you make it look so easy?
I'm so bad at letting go
How do you make it look so easy?

Cut me open, take my heart
So we'll never be apart
Don't you let it go to waste
When you walk away
I can feel it in my bones, you don't love me anymore
Make it worth all of the pain
When you walk away

I'm so bad at letting go
How do you make it look so easy?
When you walk away
I'm so bad at letting go
How do you make it look so easy?
When you walk away

Lined up, lookin' like Cobain
Drugs drippin' off of my nose ring
Lil Peep, bitch, I'm a no name
But it's a lot of shit that I don't say

And there's always whiskey on your breath
But you're the best that I can do
And I, I think I love you."

But I can't wait around for something better than this
Because you're the best that I can do
And I, I wish I could leave you."

Armor truck heist, get a bonus like N'Bushe
In love with you since the days of "Juicy"
Now I watch you play Columbo, Picasso
Tricks inside colassals, turn you castles to brothels, uh!

Under pressure, I lie for ya, die for ya
Ruger by the thigh for you, right hand high for ya
Because of you, I'm inheritin' trillions
Buryin' billions, Bentley Coupe millions

Queen Bees, ah-hah, that's me

How you feeling, everybody? Hope you had a nice day
Sometimes I feel all alone
Sometimes I can't get away
I feel my life is in danger every night when I lay
So can you do me a favor, smile for me?

I know they wanna see me fall, I know they fraudulent, I know
I know they hoping that it's right back to the ghettos I go
I know my pigment is not that of a businessmen
I know they think I'm ignorant I'm fucking up my privilege
I know that money come and go so money not my motive no mo’
I made enough to know Ill never make enough for my soul
I turned my back on my friends
I turned my back on my home
I left the street where I've grown
To chase the yellow brick road
I heard they paved it with gold I turned around and seen they pissed on it
Just like me
But that's alright because my soul burning please set me free
I hope to see you in another life times mines just not for me
Can’t you see?

Every night up on my knees I pray
Smile for me
That everything will change and be ok
Smile for me
Maybe I'll stay maybe I'll pass away
Smile for me
I'm holding on to what the pastor say
Smile for me

Smile for me
Smile for me
Smile for me
Smile for me
'Cause when life gets hard
And you just think
You wanna end it all
Smile for me
When life gets hard
And you can’t breathe
You wanna end it all
Smile for me
Smile for me

How you feeling, everybody? Hope you had a nice day
Sometimes I feel all alone
Sometimes I can't get away
I feel my life is in danger every night when I pray
So could you do me a favor, smile for me?

I don't love you, you don't love me, we should give it up
Wish I felt your body without me getting my feeling's touched
People tell me I'm too young and I should live it up
How could you not feel that? These freaks wanna give it up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Don't say you feel my pain cause I don't even feel myself
Blood rushing through my brain, sometimes I wanna kill myself
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Motion of the ocean waves capsize me, baptize my frame
Salt water inside my wounds, still don't know who to blame
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up

Don't go
'Cause I can't see you gone
And if you were to go then I would probably dig a hole
Underground, I'd be safe and sound
I wouldn't have to see you
Or your other friends in town
Don't stare
'Cause I can't see you there
I know it annoys you when I act like I don't care
I do
I once did love you
But now I'm feeling opposite
Like red does blue

So get out my face
And leave me be
I don't love you
And you certi don't love me
So this is all wrong
Your argument is long and now you've overstayed your welcome
And I wish you were gone
I wish you were gone

Your smile
That was worth the while
You say you don't love me
But I say you're in denial
I prove
I once did love you
But now I'm feeling opposite and I don't know what to do
So get out my face
And leave me be
I don't love you
And you certi don't love me
So this is all wrong
Your argument is long and now you've overstayed your welcome
But I wish you were gone
I wish you were gone
So fuckin' bad

And I know you
Don't want me in your world
But let me tell you
I'm fine with that, girl
If you really
Think me as a tool
I might tell you
My feelings on you
Joan
'Cause girl

So won't you get out my face
And leave me be
I don't love you
And you certi don't love me
So this is all wrong
Your argument is long and now you've overstayed your welcome
And I wish you were gone
I wish you were gone

I said I wish you were gone 
I said I wish you were gone 
I said I wish you were gone 

So fuckin' bad

was all right for awhile
I could smile for awhile
But I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say, "Hello"

Oh, you wished me well
You couldn't tell
That I'd been crying over you
Crying over you

When you said, "So long"
Left me standing all alone
Alone and crying, crying
Crying, crying

It's hard to understand
But the touch of your hand
Can start me crying
I thought that I was over you

But it's true, so true
I love you even more
Than I did before
But, darling, what can I do?

For you don't love me
And I'll always be crying over you
Crying over you
Yes, now you're gone
And from this moment on
I'll be crying, crying
Crying, crying
Yeah, crying, crying
Over you

You don't love me like you used to (like you used to, like you used to)
You don't touch me like you used to (like you used to, like you used to)
Where did I go wrong? When did I lose focus?
When did you move on? It seems like I never noticed

I've been looking for love in all the wrong places (all the wrong places)
And I've been looking for you in other girl's faces, it's time that I face it (in other girl's faces)
I messed up with you
I played the game but I broke all the rules

I fell out of paradise
And now all I do is cry
It hurts when you fall out of paradise
It cuts me just like a knife
Got me all of out place and it don't feel right
Got lost in the sauce
And now I'm paying the price
I fell out of paradise

You giving all my love to a stranger, no, no
But you know that's not how it's 'posed to go
You changing on me, oh, when did your heart turn cold?
When did our love get old? (Old)

'Cause I've been looking for love in all the wrong places (ooh, babe)
And I've been looking for you in other girl's faces, it's time that I face it
I messed up with you
I played the game but I broke all the rules

Got lost in the sun
And now I'm paying the price

Huh, yeah, we fell off, you moved on, I'm tryna play it off (yeah, yeah)
I send that text, you decline my message, press and ignore (oh)
Take you from Michael Kors to cameras recording you (oh)
Now I made you famous, couldn't stop it if I wanted to (yeah)
Damn, it's the honest truth, I need my bitch a hunnid proof (yeah, hey)
Forget about the past, girl, let's call a truce (yeah)
And I didn't wanna put no pain on you
I didn't want my heart to stain on you (yeah, yeah)
Falling out of paradise
And I feel like you're holding my all and outta sight

I fell out of paradise (oh)
And now all I do is cry, (cry)
It hurts when you fall out of paradise (fall, fall)
It cuts me just like a knife (ooh, oh)
Got me all of out place and it don't feel right (oh, woah)

Harvestin' shit into somethin' that benefis
All of my bitches that wanna get mine

I need a comfort that I am not talkin'
To one that sit back at the bed when I sleep on the road
I been keepin' all the secrets
I know you know that I got women I keep on the low
You know we move through the city like general pimpin'
While women just creep on the low
Me? I’m just rollin', I’m hopin' my soon to be finished
Relationship turned into somethin' that grow
Coulda been makin' this somethin'
I coulda been fussin' about makin' us lovers
But fuck it, I’m back on this playin' shit, though

You say you love me, save that shit

Can you lick the tip then throat the dick or nah?
You gon' let me stretch that pussy out or nah?
I'm not the type to call you back tomorrow
But the way you wrapping 'round me is a prob
Ain't nobody tryna save ya
Baby, get that paper
Probably got a lot of other bitches owe you favours
Pussy so good, I had to save that shit for later, later
Panda, Panda, Panda

I got broads in Atlanta
Twisting dope, lean, and the Fanta
Credit cards and the scammers
Hitting off licks in the bando
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, panda
Going out like I'm Montana
Hundred killers, hundred hammers

I don't want a good girl, I been rolling with the baddest
She told me she models and she told me she an actress
Talking 'bout her, she been everywhere up on the atlas
Doesn't make a difference, she still end up on my mattress
Fuck your 15 minutes, I'm the man of the hour
No more room up in my bed, let's take it to the shower
Talking how she love me and she don't want me without her
You don't love me, you just love my money and my power
Hey, cause girl I'm on
And if you need a drink, you take anything you want
Cause it don't mean a thing, you can see 'em bringing more
Cause when we do our thing, table's shining like New York

Oh my, oh my, what a wonderful time
It's been a minute since I pulled up outside
Shut it down, yeah, we do that every time
Oh-wee got a feeling you might, yeah
Got a feeling you might, yeah
Got a feeling, got a feeling you might, yeah, might year


Ohh
Show you somethin' you never seen
Yeah

[Chorus]
I don't fit right, anomalies
And I don't accept how you lyin' to me
See yourself all in my dreams
Show you somethin' you never seen

I don't seem to understand these things
I be rollin' outta bounds
I keep a beam steady goin' on lean
Love over passion, tell me what it mean
Live like a gangster, I don't fit right with them things
Money talkin' like a preacher, blew that strap in the bottom
He tried runnin', knew they was comin', bounty hunters done caught
Toss all yo' feelings in a lake once they locked in a bottle
I'm too aggressive, please excuse me
You know how I'm rockin', I'm thuggin'

I don't fit right, anomalies
And I don't accept how you lyin' to me
See yourself all in my dreams
Show you somethin' you never seen
I don't fit right, anomalies
And I don't accept how you lyin' to me
See yourself all in my dreams
Show you somethin' you never seen

You actin' funny all of a sudden
Well, bitch, just say you don't love me
Infiltratin', gone on occasions like you tryna hide somethin'
I never lie, always admit 'cause I be feelin' like, "fuck it"
I wouldn’t want you to lie to me, you happy when you leave
I been done dirty and I’m scarred so I don't fuck with no bitch
You probably fuckin' but I still won’t let a hoe suck my dick
You got me fuckin' up my song 'cause I’m so mad about the shit
I just got spirits on my phone, it ain’t no human you bitch, haha

I don't fit right, anomalies
And I don't accept how you lyin' to me
See yourself all in my dreams
Show you somethin' you never seen
I don't fit right, anomalies
And I don't accept how you lyin' to me
See yourself all in my dreams
Show you somethin' you never seen

There's a thousand words that I could say
To make you come home, yeah
Seems so long ago you walked away
Left me alone
And I remember what you said to me
You were acting so strange
And maybe I was too blind to see
That you needed a change

Was it something I said
To make you turn away
To make you walk out and leave me cold
If I could just find a way
To make it so that you were right here
Right now

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
(Can't get you off my mind)
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
(Touch your face)
But the truth remains you're

Gone (You're)
Gone (Baby you're)
Gone (Girl you're gone, baby girl you're)
Gone (You're)
Gone (You're)

Now I don't wanna make excuses, baby
Won't change the fact that you're gone...no, no
But if there's something that I could do
Won't you please let me know?
The time is passing so slowly now
Guess that's my life without you
(Guess that's my life without you)
And maybe I could change my every day
But baby I don't want to

So I'll just hang around
And find some things to do
To take my mind off missing you (take my mind off missing you)
And I know in my heart
You can't say that you don't love me too
Please say you do...Yeah

I've been sitting here (sitting here)
Can't get you off my mind (get you off of my mind)
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong (my best to be a man and be strong)
I drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face (Wishing I could touch your face)
But the truth remains you're (truth remains you're)

Gone (You're)
Gone (you're)
Gone (You're gone, you're)
Gone (You're)
Gone

Ohhh...

What will I do
If I can't be with you
Tell me where will I turn to
Baby who will I be
Now that we are apart
Am I still in your heart
Baby why don't you see
That I need you here with me
Oohhh...

I've been sitting here (sitting here)
Can't get you off my mind
(Can't get you off my mind)
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
(My best to be a man)
I drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
(Ooh pinch you baby, Oh)
But the truth remains (the truth remains you're gone)

I've been sitting here (sitting here)
Can't get you off my mind
(Can't get you off my mind)
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
(My best to be a man)
I drove myself insane (Oh, oh, oh)
Wishing I could touch your face
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
But the truth remains you're....
(Oh, oh...Baby the truth is you're)


Gone (You're)
Gone (You're)
Gone (You're gone, baby girl you're)
Gone (You're)
Gone

But the truth remains you're...

I don't wanna tell my parents, wanna tell my sister
You don't wanna tell your friends
You don't wanna pack your stuff
Fall back in love with another girl again
All alone, picking up take out
Coming home to an empty house
Admittin' that the time we spent
Was just a lesson

We've got all our reasons why
We try to justify
Sticking it out, to stay together
And we're supposed to last forever
You and I, too scared to say goodbye
In case of what will happen later
We're not doing us any favors

I'm so sick of living a lie
So screw all of our reasons why

We feel like roommates, standing at the same sink
We don't even kiss goodnight
I don't wanna be a quitter, don't wanna have to answer
When everybody asks me why
Giving all your t-shirts back
Putting all my stuff in bags
We were supposed to be married by the time 'bout the time we're 30
Breaking up is scary

All these reasons why
We try to justify
Sticking it out, to stay together
And we're supposed to last forever
You and I, too scared to say goodbye
In case of what will happen later
We're not doing us any favors

I'm so sick of living a lie
So screw all of our reasons why
Goodbye

I don't love you, you don't love me
It can be, it can be just that simple, baby
I don't love you, you don't love me
It can be, it should be just that simple, baby
I don't love you, you don't love me
It can be, it can be just that simple, baby
I don't love you, you don't love me
It can be, it should be just that simple, baby (yeah)

Reasons why
We try to justify (justify)
Sticking it out, to stay together
And we're supposed to last forever
You and I (you and I), too scared to say goodbye (goodbye)
In case of what will happen later
We're not doing us any favors

With money and the fame and the women
With the luxury cars and the all the spending

Smoking on Jamaican, that's that uptown girl
Gave you keys to that drop (drop), hundred G's it's a shot (shot)
Bal harbor, to the harbor, diving off of them yachts
Body look like a stallion, girl, hit the gym and coast fiending
Used to go with just window shop, couldn't even go send it
Got too used to that winning (winning), I got used to them women
Now you beef, stay at least, never dreamed to this ending

You said you'd love me long time girl
But now you say I call you at the wrong time, girl
Oh you acting different (different), what you out here slipping (slipping)
Run the streets with these enemies and make me no difference
Show me that catalogue, to hermans I cope that
They said it only come in hard top, I drop that
Mama said you don't love me (love me), shit about to get ugly
Would you love me and fuck me, if I wasn't getting this money

If I ain't have that theory, five karat earrings
Girl would you love me for me?
When that money get low you started tripping
Now you walking out the door and you flipping
Even my mama said you wasn't gon' love me
From the beginning

Word of mouth got you picked up
No evidence in that room (What?)
They gon' try to break you (Shh)
Stay silent, don't fold
They can't do shit but hold you (Under)
72 hour investigation (That's it)
'Member all the times I was robbin' just to come up (Come up)
Lookin' for a lick late night 'til the sun up (Remember)
Sippin' 'Tuss straight out the bottle, put the cup up (Yellow)
Thinkin' 'bout your fuck-ups while you light the blunt up
She barely wanted you back when you had payments
Pink slip now, but your cars was rented
Got booked with a record, I ain't talkin' 'bout Guinness
She gon' fuck the next nigga when you get sentenced (Damn)
I can't forget where I came from (Came from)
It's to the point where the pain numb (Can't feel)
Lost his dog while incarcerated
Got to hear 'bout the funeral, can't come (What it do?)

He gotta live with it forever (Forever)
Closin' your eyes, it ain't no better (Why?)
Visualizin' all the time together (Damn)

We used to sleep on the floor, now you don't love me no more
I done been broke before, I done been in the rain
Ridin' 'round spendin' and things, now I'm in Fendi and things
Got me on Xannies and things, all I be feelin' is pain

Hard to separate fake when they all friendly
I'm in tune with reality (Yeah)
So I never let myself get caught up in it (Nope)
Perceivin' new haters knowin' that's comin' with it
Be your own charge partner, nigga fuck a codefendant
Seem like it come and find you when you tryin' to prevent it
Same dude body dropped, prayed 'bout it, I'll repent it
It 'posed to be us back to back in them Bentleys

Hate your friends
I hate your mom and dad
I hope they hate me back
I guess for once, I'm being honest
Gotta be a lot that's wrong with you
To want to be with me
It's kind of sweet when we

We fight until someone's calling the cops
But you never blame it on me
You're so annoying
Four in the morning, you're changing the locks
How could you do this to me-e-e? (Oh)

I, I, I only love, love you when you don't love me
So, why do you, why do you, why do you love me?
I, I, I only need, need you when you don't need me
So, why do you, why do you, why do you love me?

Apologize, never apologize
You hate the way I lie
So here you go, I'm being honest
Narcissist, come on, give us a kiss
Let's have some fun with it
It's kinda sweet (It's kinda sweet)

Four in the morning, you're changing the locks
How could you do this to me-e-e? (Oh)

I, I, I only love, love you when you don't love me
Oh, baby, so, why do you, why do you, why do you love me?
I, I, I only need, need you when you don't need me
(Only when you don't need me, baby)
So, why do you, why do you, why do you love me?

If I'm fucking crazy, you're fucking crazy, we're all fucking crazy
Why do you, why do you, why do you love me?
I, I, I only love, love you when you don't love me
So, why do you, why do you, why do you love me?

 (Why do you, why do you)

(Don't need me, don't need me)
So, why do you, why do you, why do you love me?

Well I stepped into an avalanche
It covered up my soul;
When I am not this hunchback that you see
I sleep beneath the golden hill
You who wish to conquer pain
You must learn, learn to serve me well

You strike my side by accident
As you go down for your gold
The cripple here that you clothe and feed
Is neither starved nor cold;
He does not ask for your company
Not at the centre, the centre of the world

When I am on a pedestal
You did not raise me there
Your laws do not compel me
To kneel grotesque and bare
I myself am the pedestal
For this ugly hump at which you stare

You who wish to conquer pain
You must learn what makes me kind;
The crumbs of love that you offer me
They're the crumbs I've left behind
Your pain is no credential here
It's just the shadow, shadow of my wound

I have begun to long for you
I who have no greed
I have begun to ask for you
I who have no need
You say you've gone away from me
But I can feel you when you breathe

Do not dress in those rags for me
I know you are not poor
You don't love me quite so fiercely now
When you know that you are not sure
It is your turn, beloved
It is your flesh that I wear

I listen for your footsteps coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps, but they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear, on my old front door
I don't hear it--does it mean you don't love me any more?

I hear the clock a'ticking on the mantle shelf
See the hands a'moving, but I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight, and why I'm by myself
I don't see you--does it mean you don't love me any more?

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so how I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

I'm sorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair
You were in a car crash, and you lost your hair
You said that you would be late, about an hour or two
I said that's alright, I'm waiting here, just waiting to hear from you

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, I'll hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, I'll hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

Love?
You know, what do you know about love?
What do you possibly think you know about love?
You know, I'm sick and tired of men usin' love as some kind of disease you just catch
Love should've brought your ass home last night!
I heard you say you sorry, you sorry and you tired
You don't love me!
You only love your damn self!"

You give your hand to me
And then you say, "Hello"
And I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so
And anyone can tell
You think you know me well
Well, you don't know me no
No you don't know the one
Who dreams of you each night
And longs to kiss your lips
And longs to hold you tight
To you I'm just a friend
That's all I've ever been
No you don't know me

I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you, yeah
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by
A chance that you might love me too

You give your hand to me
And then you say, "Goodbye"
And I watched you walk away
Beside the lucky guy
No you'll never ever know
The one who loved you so
No you don't know me

I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you, yeah
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by
A chance that you might love me too

You give your hand to me
And then you say, "Goodbye"
And I watched you walk away
Beside the lucky guy
No you'll never ever know
The one who loved you so
No you don't know me

I say you never ever know
The one who loved you so
No you don't know me
No you don't love me

Dead roses on Valentine's
Rumours lying on grape vines
Your love washes over me like cheap red wine
But you feel on your lows and they leave me dry
I live on a broken Earth
Scream and, boy, you shout me first
Your blood washes over me like cheap red wine
Your words are like bullets, leave me to die

When you don’t love me
When you don't need me
When you don't want me
Darlin’, it's time
When you don't love me
When you don't need me
When you don't want me
Darlin', it's time

Won't stay when I’m not welcomed
Swarms in and I have been stung
Your love washes over me like gin and lime
Your words are so cold, leave me with frostbite
Do I need truth or healing? (Get up)
Down your neck, I’m breathing (Get up)
I need to feel needed (Get up)
This doesn't justify, yeah

When you don’t love me (When you don't love me)
When you don't need me (When you don't need me)
When you don’t want me (When you don't want me)
Darlin' it's time (Darlin', it's time)
When you don't love me (When you don't love)
When you don't need me (Oh)
When you don't want me
Darlin' it's time

 I hear thunder in the distance
And it hits me in an instant
Crashing through my heart and I'm blown apart
You don't love me like that, you don't love me like that

I feel the cool wind coming in before the summer rain
Eyes to the sky staring into the blue like it's not gonna end
Remember we needed all our days and nights
To get enough of us to satisfy
We played that out a thousand times

Now I hear thunder in the distance
And it hits me in an instant
Crashing through my heart and I'm blown apart
You don't love me like that (you don't love me like that)
Yeah, I hear thunder in the distance
And the storm is in our system
I've been shaken out; I can see it now
You don't love me like that (you don't love me like that)

I feel the cool wind coming in before the summer rain
Eyes to the sky staring into the blue like it's not gonna end
Remember we had a force like oh, my God
Too fast, too strong, too hard to stop
Remember when we couldn't get enough?

Now I hear thunder in the distance
And it hits me in an instant
Crashing through my heart and I'm blown apart
You don't love me like that (you don't love me like that)
Yeah, I hear thunder in the distance
And the storm is in our system
I've been shaken out; I can see it now
You don't love me like that (you don't love me like that)

No, you don't love me (no, you don't love me like that, that, that)
You don't love (you don't love me like that, that)
No, you don't love me like that (no, you don't love me like that, that, that)
(You don't love me like that, that) You don't love me, you don't love me, baby
(No, you don't love me like that, that, that) No, no, no
(You don't love me like that, that) No, no, no
(No, you don't love me like that, that, that) No, no, oh
(You don't love me like that, that)

(No, you don't love me like that, that, that)
(You don't love me like that, that)
(No, you don't love me like that, that, that)
(You don't love me like that, that)

I hear thunder in the distance
And it hits me in an instant
Crashing through my heart and I'm blown apart
You don't love me like that (you don't love me like that)
Yeah, I hear thunder in the distance
And the storm is in our system
I've been shaken out; I can see it now
You don't love me like that, oh (you don't love me)
No, you don't love me like that, that
No, you don't love, no, you don't love
No, you don't love me like that
No, you don't love, no, you don't love

Well I hear my train coming
Hear my train coming

Well, I wait around the train station
Waiting for that train
Take me, take me, take me away
From this lonesome town
Lonesome town
Too bad you don't love me any more, girl
Too bad your people put me down
Hey, hey, hey

Tears burning me
Tears burning me in my eyes
Way down, way down in my soul
Burning me way down in my heart
Too bad you don't love me no more, girl
Too bad you and me have to part
Have to part

Well I hear my train coming
Hear my train coming
Well I hear my train coming
Hear my train coming

I was hoping that you'd stay
‘Cause tonight I wanna stay up late
I was hoping that you'd say
That you were feeling lonely just like me
I'm still hoping that you're happy
‘Cause you know I can barely stand up straight
I'm still hoping that I can be, everything that you would ask of me

But am I
All wrong
Long gone
Too far from your heart
Last year was hard
I fell apart

I know you don't feel this way but
I'll try to convince you so
If it's lost
Or if it's fate
I hope you pick up this late

I know you don't feel this way but
I'll try to convince you so
If it's lost
Or if it's fate
I hope you pick up this late

I've been missing how we'd pretend
Cause tonight I really need a friend
We pretended we were happy
Maybe we can try and start it again
But am I
All wrong
Long gone
Too far from your heart
Last year was hard
I fell apart

I know you don't feel this way but
I'll try to convince you so
If it's lost
Or if it's fate
I hope you pick up this late
I know you don't feel this way but
I'll try to convince you so
If it's love
Or if it's fate
I hope you pick up this late

Ooooh…

I never thought that we'd end up like this
But the cycling it makes me sick
It's a long shot and I can't tell
It's another coin in the wishing well
Another coin in a wishing well

Honestly if I'm being honest with myself
I know which way you fell
You don't love me I can tell

I know you don't feel this way but
I'll try to convince you so
If it's lost
Or if it's fate
I hope you pick up this late
I know you don't feel this way but
I'll try to convince you so
If it's love
Or if it's fate
I hope you pick up this late

I hope you pick up this late
I hope you pick up this late


They told me in the street that you're going around asking for me
(Going around asking)
I don’t know if they told you, but I'm not going around looking for love
(I'm looking for)
I’m wild/free, I don't even need your wallet
(I have mine (my own))
Even less some guy like you to maintain me

Let go of your little game already, you don't love me
I don't need a man to fuck me
I buy my (own) things, you don't control me
I'm better on my own rather than with you
(Listen)

I don't wash the dishes for you
Nor do I iron your clothes
If that's what you’re looking for
Then go find someone else
Nor do I know how to cook for you
But yes I do know how to give you love-ove
If you want me to be trapped
Then no, oh
The answer to your question is no
No, no, no and no
The answer to your question is no
No, no, no and no

 (Becky G, Maluma, baby)
Calm down mami, ’cuz I already know
Do your thing(s) and I'll wash my car
I know how you feel and I don’t mind
I'm looking for an independent woman
I always wanted someone like you-you
Who has a shield and is all about the attitude-tude
If you're looking for a man who's not going to fuck you
He doesn’t exist, you're going to end up alone
Hahaha

No, no, no and no
The answer to your question is no
No, no, no and no

Yeah-yeah
A while ago, I had a feeling
That you loved me/wanted me
And the intentions that you had
Were because my bed was cold
For that reason, you thought
That you deserved this reward

Sorry baby if I insist so much
But the thing is that you have a "reward" that drives me crazy, crazy
I left everyone waiting, I'll calm myself, I promise
You can treat me bad if you give me a kiss at the end (Mua!; Hahaha)

The answer to your question is no
No, no, no and no
The answer to your question is no
No, no, no and no
I always insist but she says no (Becky G, Dirty Boy; Yeah-yeah)
No, no, no, no
Yeah-yeah, eh-eh-eh (Maluma, baby, Becky G)

oddamn it, Andrew! If you're going to succeed at this thing you're trying to do...you've got to stop being so damn deferential!
-I can't help being deferential. It's built-in!
-Then change!
- Change? I have changed!
- I don't mean on the outside. Change on the inside. Take chances, make mistakes. Sometimes it's important not to be perfect. It's important to do the wrong thing!
-Do the wrong thing?
-Yes
- Why? I see. To learn from your mistakes
- No. To make them! To find out what's real and what's not, to find out what you feel. Human beings are terrible messes!
- I'll grant you that. I see, this is what is known as an irrational conversation, isn't it?
- This is a human conversation. It's not about being rational. It's about following your heart!
-And that's what I should do?
-Yes. And you have a heart, Andrew. I feel it. I don't even believe it sometimes, but I do feel it!
- And in order to follow that heart...one must do the wrong thing
- Yes!
- Thank you!



-So you're not married yet?
-No, two weeks from Saturday
-I'm not too late. Are you positive you're doing the right thing?
-Positive?
-About getting married?
-I'm never absolutely positive on anything!
-You could be doing the wrong thing!
-I'm pretty sure I'm doing the right thing
-Great!
-Why is that great?
-You told me to do the wrong thing. You aren't doing the wrong thing, you're doing the right thing. Safe to say, you're not following your own advice, 'cause if you were, you wouldn't marry him
-Because I would be doing the right thing
-Precisely!
-In some strange way, you're starting to make sense!
-Good. Do you have any idea what it's like to be in love with someone who's marrying someone else? Someone who's totally magnificent? Someone who walks into a room and lights it up like the sun? Someone who you know is lying to herself?
-Lying?
-Convincingly. Very very much so
-About what?
-That you don't love me when I know, at least in some way, you do!
-And how do you know that?
-Portia, I have done everything, inside and out!
-That stuff doesn't matter to me!
-Well, something matters. 'cause if I'd have to believe that nothing mattered, you'd love me...and not some man whose chin could sink the Titanic! What? See? It's true, isn't it?
-Sorry
-Does he light you up like this? Does he make you laugh?
-Nobody makes me laugh like this!
-Good. Then admit it. Admit that you love me. Give me one kiss. That's all: One quick kiss. Just one kiss could not jeopardize a glorious marriage. Besides, it would also explain why your pulse just jumped from 66 to 102 beats per minute. Your respiration is doubled. You're putting out clouds of pheromones, Portia
-It's not fair to read me like that!
-I know. Love isn't fair. I'm reading your heart. I'm asking you to follow it. Begging you. Begging is supposed to be humiliating, I don't care. I love you, Portia. I loved you the very first moment I saw you!

Yeah, yeah, uh

I'm speeding on the freeway tryna get home
Pushing it to the max, she can't wait that long
Feel like I'm gonna crash and burn
I hit my last turn, but she already let my hands go like
Cruise control, let me hands go like
Cruise control, let me hands go like
Cruise control, let me hands go like
Cruise control

Feel like just a week ago we were so equal
Where we get divided, my time is for me though
Wish that I could repo your love and sew up your heart
I see you hurting from the pain, I shoulda known from the start
But now I'm speeding, leaning, pedal to the metal
I got my reasons but all they worth finna losing you forever no
I'm down girl, knee deep
In between the lines, tell me can you read this
Issues on top of issues
Better leave them in the rear view, baby it's official
I need you on my side, by my side like a pistol
So baby girl don't leave me, bring that back, replay

I'm speeding on the freeway tryna get home
Pushing it to the max, she can't wait that long
Feel like I'm gonna crash and burn
I hit my last turn, but she already let my hands go like
Cruise control, let me hands go like
Cruise control, let me hands go like
Cruise control, let me hands go like
Cruise control

Go, why you let me go?
Really needed you there, shoulda let me know
Uh, coulda let it show, no reason to be insecure
Swear I got everything you need but you tell me you still need more
So now I'm swerving, far away from perfect
Then you pay attention and tell me it was worth it, worth this
I got my foot to where the gas
Tryna make it fast, we gotta make it last, uh

Baby I don't know how we ended up, never thought we'd end up this way
Can't eat, can't sleep, nobody coulda told me there would come a day
That you don't love me, you don't care
I'll be turning over, you won't be there

Gone, can't believe she gone
It didn't seem that long, but now we all alone
Musta made a wrong turn somewhere, tell you where it is but you heard something else
He say, she say, CA

I'm speeding on the freeway tryna get home
Pushing it to the max, she can't wait that long
Feel like I'm gonna crash and burn

Dear God, I'm trying hard to reach you
Dear God, I see your face in all I do
Sometimes it's so hard to believe in

Dear God, I think it's time we had a conversation
These lonely nights is getting to me so my mind is racin'
I think about this life I live and all the shit I'm facin'
More secrets in my mind than a Freemason
I get lonely at times, and then I write these rhymes
I'm only human, I want to hit the club and fuck a dime
But I know that's not the answer to my problems
Lord help me solve them, disintegrate and dissolve 'em
Layin' in bed with a girl I'm pretty sure is my next
Contemplating the sex while I think about my ex
Am I wrong? Yeah
Dear God, am I wrong? Uh (Dear God)
Dear God, tell me, am I wrong?
For livin' the life of a king surrounded by these pawns
Fans telling me I'm the greatest but I never hear 'em
'Cause I ain't hit the pinnacle, yeah, I'm still persevering
Demons whispering in my ears, but no, I never fear them
People thinking they on his level they ain't even near him
I just want to spread positivity through lyrical ability
They call it selling out but I just call it versatility
Yeah, it's my life, my wrongs, and my rights
My battle, my songs, and my fights
Now everybody want to come around?
Tell me where was you last year when a brother was down?
Not a single one of you motherfuckers believed in the brand
Extended a hand, and now you wanna be my man?
I think not, you quick to shape shift like ink blots
The real Dilla, we cut classic, no fitters
What about the time I was nine and my mama almost murdered me?
Don't think I forgot that shit, it still burdens me
Her bare hands tight around my throat
"I can't breathe" I screamed, "I can't breathe, Mama
Don't you want me, Mama? Don't you love me, Mama?" What the fuck
Where was you then God? Tell me now
How's a brother supposed to stay sane? Tell me how
Why you let me live but let another die?
Why you dry my tears but let another cry? Gotta know
Set to detonate, I gotta blow, that shit fo' sho
I used to wonder why in the hell you would make me suffer
But now in the end I understand that it made me tougher

I get up when I'm down, had enough, almost drowned
When shit rough, I get tough and when I'm beaten to the ground
I get up, yeah
I get up, yeah, yeah
I get up when I'm down, had enough, almost drowned
When shit rough, I get tough and when I'm beaten to the ground
I get up, yeah
I get up, I get up
Get up
