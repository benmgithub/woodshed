Smells Like Teen Spirit
Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over-bored and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word

Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us

A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end

Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us

A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

And I forget, just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, it's hard to find
Oh well, whatever, nevermind

Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us

“Come As You Are” 

A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

A denial, a denial
A denial, a denial

Come as you are
As you were
As I want you to be

As a friend
As a friend
As an old enemy

Take your time
Hurry up
The choice is yours
Don't be late

Take a rest
As a friend
As an old memoria
Memoria
Memoria

Come doused in mud
Soaked in bleach
As I want you to be

As a trend
As a friend

“My Girl”

My girl, my girl don't lie to me
tell me where did you sleep last night?
in the pines, in the pines
where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

My girl, my girl where will you go
I'm going where the cold wind blows
in the pines, in the pines
where the sun do not ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

Her husband was a hard working man
Just about a mile from here
his head was found in a driving wheel
but his body never was found

my girl my girl don't lie to me
tell me where did you sleep last night?
in the pines, in the pines
where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night Thought

my girl, my girl where will you go
I'm going where the cold wind blows
in the pines, in the pines
where the sun do not ever shine

My girl, my girl where will you go
I'm going where the cold wind blows
in the pines, in the pines
where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver! Thought the whole night thought...

“Heart Shaped Box”

She eyes me like a pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap

Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back

“Lithium”

I'm so happy
'Cause today I found my friends
They're in my head
I'm so ugly
That's okay 'cause so are you
Broke our mirrors
Sunday morning is everyday for all I care
And I'm not scared, light my candles
In a daze 'cause I've found God
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm so lonely
That's okay, I shaved my head
And I'm not sad and just maybe
I'm to blame for all I've heard
I'm not sure, I'm so excited

I can't wait to meet you there

“All Apologies”

What else should I be?
All apologies
What else could I say?
Everyone is gay
What else should I write?
I don't have the right
What else should I be?
All apologies

In the sun
In the sun I feel as one
In the sun
In the sun
Married
Buried

I wish I was like you
Easily amused
Find my nest of salt
Everything is my fault
I'll take all the blame
Aqua sea foam shame
Sunburn freezer burn
Choking on the ashes of her enemy

In the sun
In the sun I feel as one

In the sun
Married

 “Astronomy Domine”
Lime and limpid green, a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew.
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground.
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania.
Neptune, Titan, Stars can frighten.
Lime and limpid green, a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew.
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground.
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania.
Neptune, Titan, Stars can frighten.
Blinding signs flap,
Flicker, flicker, flicker blam. Pow, pow.
Stairway scare, Dan Dare, who's there?
Lime and limpid green, the sounds around
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green, the sounds around
The icy waters underground.
 
"Lucifer Sam”
 
Lucifer Sam, siam cat.
Always sitting by your side
Always by your side.
That cat's something I can't explain.
Ginger, ginger, Jennifer Gentle you're a witch.
You're the left side
He's the right side.
Oh, no!
That cat's something I can't explain.
Lucifer go to sea.
Be a hip cat, be a ship's cat.
Somewhere, anywhere.
That cat's something I can't explain.
At night prowling sifting sand.
Hiding around on the ground.
He'll be found when you're around.
That cat's something I can't explain.
 
"Matilda Mother"
 
There was a king who ruled the land
His majesty was in command
With silver eyes the scarlet eagle
Showers silver on the people
Oh Mother, tell me more
Why'd'ya have to leave me there
Hanging in my infant air
Waiting?
You only have to read the lines
They're scribbly black and everything shines
Across the stream with wooden shoes
With bells to tell the king the news
A thousand misty riders climb up
Higher once upon a time
Wandering and dreaming
The words have different meaning
Yes they did
For all the time spent in that room
The doll's house, darkness, old perfume
And fairy stories held me high on
Clouds of sunlight floating by
Oh Mother, tell me more
Tell me more
Aaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaah
 
"Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun"
 
Little by little the night turns around
Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn
Lotus's lean on each other in yearning
Over the hills a swallow is resting
Set the controls for the heart of the sun
 
Over the mountain watching the watcher
Breaking the darkness, waking the grapevine
Knowledge of love is knowledge of shadow
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine
 
Set the controls for the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
 
Witness the man who waves at the wall
Making the shape of his question to Heaven
Whether the sun will fall in the evening
Will he remember the lesson of giving?
 
Set the controls for the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
 
"Speak To Me"
 
"I've been mad for fucking years, absolutely years, been
over the edge for yonks, been working me buns off for bands..."
"I've always been mad, I know I've been mad, like the
most of us...very hard to explain why you're mad, even
if you're not mad..."
 
"Breathe"
 
Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave, don't leave me
Look around, choose your own ground
 
Long you live and high you fly
Smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be
 
Run, rabbit, run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
When at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one
 
Long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
Balanced on the biggest wave
Race towards an early grave
 
"Time"
 
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
 
Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun
 
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
 
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say
 
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away, across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spell
 
"Breathe - Reprise"
 
Home, home again
I like to be there when I can
When I come in cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells.
 
"The Great Gig In The Sky"
 
And I am not frightened of dying, any time will do, I don't mind.
Why should I be frightened of dying?
There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime.
 
I never said I was frightened of dying.
 
"Money"
 
Money, get away
Get a good job with more pay and you're O.K.
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four star daydream,
Think I'll buy me a football team
 
Money, get back
I'm all right, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack.
Money, it's a hit
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity first-class traveling set
And I think I need a Learjet
 
Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a rise it's no surprise that they're giving none away
 
"Ha-ha! I was in the right!"
"Yes, absolutely in the right!"
"I certainly was in the right!"
"Yeah, I was definitely in the right. That geezer was cruising for a bruising!"
"Why does anyone do anything?"
"Yeah!"
"Why does anyone do anything?"
"I don't know, I was really drunk at the time!"
"I was just telling him it was in, he could get it in Number Two. He was asking why it wasn't coming up on freight eleven. After, I was yelling and screaming and telling him why it wasn't coming up on freight eleven. It came to a heavy blow, which sorted the matter out."
 
"Us And Them"
 
Us and them
And after all we're only ordinary men
 
Me and you
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do
 
"Forward!" he cried
From the rear
And the front rank died
And the general sat
And the lines on the map
Moved from side to side
 
Black and blue
And who knows which is which and who is who?
 
Up and down
And in the end it's only round and round and round
 
"Haven't you heard
It's a battle of words?"
The poster bearer cried.
"Listen, son,"
Said the man with the gun,
"There's room for you inside."
 
"Well, I mean, they're gonna kill ya, so like, if you give 'em a quick sh...short, sharp shock, they don't do it again.
Dig it? I mean he got off light, 'cause I could've given him a thrashin' but I only hit him once.
It's only the difference between right and wrong, innit? I mean good manners don't cost nothing, do they? Eh?"
 
Down and out
It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about
 
With, without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
 
Out of the way
It's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For want of the price
Of tea and a slice
The old man died
 
"Brain Damage"
 
The lunatic is on the grass
The lunatic is on the grass
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
Got to keep the loonies on the path
 
The lunatic is in the hall
The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paper boy brings more
 
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon
 
The lunatic is in my head
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade, you make the change
You re-arrange me 'til I'm sane
 
You lock the door and throw away the key
There's someone in my head but it's not me.
 
And if the cloud bursts thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon
 
I can't think of anything to say except...
I think it's marvelous! Ha, ha, ha!
 
"Eclipse"
 
All that you touch
And all that you see
All that you taste
All you feel
 
And all that you love
And all that you hate
All you distrust
All you save
 
And all that you give
And all that you deal
And all that you buy,
Beg, borrow or steal
 
And all you create
And all you destroy
And all that you do
And all that you say
 
And all that you eat
And everyone you meet
And all that you slight
And everyone you fight
 
And all that is now
And all that is gone
And all that's to come
And everything under the sun is in tune
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon.
 
There is no dark side of the moon, really.
Matter of fact, it's all dark.
 
"Shine On You Crazy Diamond "
 
Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
You were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom, blown on the steel breeze.
Come on you target for faraway laughter, come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!
 
You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Well you wore out your welcome with random precision, rode on the steel breeze.
Come on you raver, you seer of visions, come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!

Nobody knows where you are, how near or how far.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Pile on many more layers and I'll be joining you there.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph,
sail on the steel breeze.
Come on you boy child, you winner and loser,
come on you miner for truth and delusion, and shine
 
"Welcome To The Machine"
 
Welcome my son, welcome to the machine.
Where have you been? It's alright we know where you've been.
You've been in the pipeline, filling in time,
provided with toys and Scouting for Boys.
You bought a guitar to punish your ma,
And you didn't like school, and you know you're nobody's fool,
So welcome to the machine.
Welcome my son, welcome to the machine.
What did you dream? It's alright we told you what to dream.
You dreamed of a big star, he played a mean guitar,
He always ate in the Steak Bar. He loved to drive in his Jaguar.
So welcome to the machine.
 
"Have A Cigar"
 
Come in here, dear boy, have a cigar.
You're gonna go far, you're gonna fly high,
You're never gonna die,
You're gonna make it if you try;
They're gonna love you.
 
Well, I've always had a deep respect,
And I mean that most sincere.
The band is just fantastic,
That is really what I think.
Oh by the way, which one's Pink?
 
And did we tell you the name of the game, boy?
We call it Riding the Gravy Train.
 
We're just knocked out.
We heard about the sell out.
You gotta get an album out,
You owe it to the people.
We're so happy we can hardly count.
 
Everybody else is just green,
Have you seen the chart?
It's a hell of a start,
It could be made into a monster
If we all pull together as a team.
 
And did we tell you the name of the game, boy?
We call it Riding the Gravy Train.
 
"Wish You Were Here"
 
So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?
 
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?
 
How I wish, how I wish you were here.
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
Running over the same old ground.
What have we found?
The same old fears.
Wish you were here.
 
"Pigs On The Wing (Part One)"
 
If you didn't care what happened to me,
And I didn't care for you
We would zig zag our way through the boredom and pain
Occasionally glancing up through the rain
Wondering which of the buggers to blame
And watching for pigs on the wing.
 
"Pigs (Three Different Ones)"
 
Big man, pig man, ha ha, charade you are
You well heeled big wheel, ha ha, charade you are
And when your hand is on your heart
You're nearly a good laugh
Almost a joker
With your head down in the pig bin
Saying "keep on digging"
Pig stain on your fat chin
What do you hope to find?
When you're down in the pig mine
You're nearly a laugh
You're nearly a laugh
But you're really a cry.
Bus stop rat bag, ha ha, charade you are
You fucked up old hag, ha ha, charade you are
You radiate cold shafts of broken glass
You're nearly a good laugh
Almost worth a quick grin
You like the feel of steel
You're hot stuff with a hat pin
And good fun with a hand gun
You're nearly a laugh
You're nearly a laugh
But you're really a cry.
Hey you Whitehouse, ha ha, charade you are
You house proud town mouse, ha ha, charade you are
You're trying to keep our feelings off the street
You're nearly a real treat
All tight lips and cold feet
And do you feel abused?
.....!.....!.....!.....!
You gotta stem the evil tide
And keep it all on the inside
Mary you're nearly a treat
Mary you're nearly a treat
But you're really a cry.
 
"Pigs On The Wing (Part Two)"
 
You know that I care what happens to you
And I know that you care for me too
So I don't feel alone
Or the weight of the stone
Now that I've found somewhere safe
To bury my bone
And any fool knows a dog needs a home
A shelter from pigs on the wing
 
"Dogs"
 
You got to be crazy, gotta have a real need
Gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street
You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking.
 
And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye, and an easy smile
 
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in.
 
You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older
Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up, fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer.
 
And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone
Dragged down by the stone.
 
I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?
Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
And everything's done under the sun
And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer.
 
Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with collar and chain
Who was given a pat on the back
Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone
 
"Sheep"
 
Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away
Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air
You better watch out
There may be dogs about
I've looked over Jordan and I have seen
Things are not what they seem
 
What do you get for pretending the danger's not real
Meek and obedient you follow the leader
Down well trodden corridors into the valley of steel
What a surprise
A look of terminal shock in your eyes
Now things are really what they seem
No, this is no bad dream
 
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He makes me down to lie
Through pastures green he leadeth me the silent waters by
With bright knives he releaseth my soul
He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places
He converteth me to lamb cutlets
For lo, he hath great power and great hunger
When cometh the day we lowly ones
Through quiet reflection and great dedication
Master the art of karate
Lo, we shall rise up
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water
 
Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream
Wave upon wave of demented avengers
March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream
 
Have you heard the news?
The dogs are dead!
You better stay home
And do as you're told
Get out of the road if you want to grow old
 
"In The Flesh?"
 
(We came in)
 
So ya thought ya might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow
 
Tell me is something eluding you sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?
 
If you want to find out what's behind these cold eyes
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise
 
"The Thin Ice"
 
Momma loves her baby
And Daddy loves you too
And the sea may look warm to you, babe
And the sky may look blue
 
Ooh, babe
Ooh, baby blue
Ooh, babe
 
If you should go skating
On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you the silent reproach
Of a million tear-stained eyes
 
Don't be surprised,
When a crack in the ice
Appears under your feet
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind
With your fear flowing out behind you
As you claw the thin ice
 
"Another Brick In The Wall (Part I)"
 
Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
A snap shot in the family album
Daddy what else did you leave for me?
 
Daddy what d'ya leave behind for me?
 
All in all it was just a brick in the wall
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall
 
"The Happiest Days Of Our Lives"
 
You! Yes, you! Stand still, laddy!
 
When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who
Would hurt the children any way they could
 
By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids
 
But in the town it was well known
When they got home at night,
Their fat and psychopathic wives
Would thrash them within inches of their lives
 
"Another Brick In The Wall (Part II)"
 
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher, leave them kids alone
 
Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone
 
All in all it's just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall
 
[Chorus by pupils from the Fourth Form Music Class Islington Green School, London]
 
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers, leave them kids alone
 
Hey, teacher, leave us kids alone
 
All in all you're just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall
 
Wrong! Do it again!
Wrong! Do it again!
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?!
You! Yes, you, behind the bike sheds, stand still, laddy!
 
"Mother"
 
Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?
Mother, do you think they'll like this song?
Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?
Ooh, aah, mother, should I build the wall?
 
Mother, should I run for president?
Mother, should I trust the government?
Mother, will they put me in the firing line?
Ooh, aah, is it just a waste of time?
 
Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mama's gonna make all of your nightmares come true
Mama's gonna put all of her fears into you
Mama's gonna keep you right here under her wing
She won't let you fly but she might let you sing
Mama's gonna keep baby cozy and warm
 
Ooh, babe, ooh, babe, ooh, babe
Of course mama's gonna help build the wall
 
Mother, do you think she's good enough for me?
Mother, do you think she's dangerous to me?
Mother, will she tear your little boy apart?
Ooh, aah, mother, will she break my heart?
 
Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mama's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you
Mama won't let anyone dirty get through
Mama's gonna wait up 'til you get in
Mama will always find out where you've been
Mamma's gonna keep baby healthy and clean
 
Ooh, babe, ooh, babe, ooh, babe
You'll always be a baby to me
 
Mother, did it need to be so high?
 
"Goodbye Blue Sky"
 
Did, did, did, did you see the frightened ones?
Did, did, did, did you hear the falling bombs?
Did, did, did, did you ever wonder
Why we had to run for shelter
When the promise of a brave new world
Unfurled beneath a clear blue sky?
 
Did, did, did, did you see the frightened ones?
Did, did, did, did you hear the falling bombs?
The flames are all long gone
But the pain lingers on
 
Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye
Goodbye
 
Hello, Luka... Congratulations. You have just discovered the secret message. Please send your answer to Old Pink, care of the Funny Farm, Chalfont...
Roger! Carolyne's on the phone!
Okay
 
What shall we use
To fill the empty spaces
Where we used to talk?
How shall I fill
The final places?
How should I complete the wall
 
"Young Lust"
 
I am just a new boy
A stranger in this town
Where are all the good times
Who's gonna show this stranger around?
Ooooooooh I need a dirty woman
Ooooooooh I need a dirty girl
Will some woman in this desert land
Make me feel like a real man
Take this rock and roll refugee
Oooh Babe set me free
Ooooooooh I need a dirty woman
Ooooooooh I need a dirty girl.
Ooooooooh I need a dirty woman
Ooooooooh I need a dirty girl.
 
"Goodbye Cruel World"
 
Goodbye cruel world
I'm leaving you today
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
 
Goodbye all you people
There's nothing you can say
To make me change my mind
Goodbye.
 
"Hey You"
 
Hey, you!
Out there in the cold
Getting lonely, getting old.
Can you feel me?
 
Hey, you!
Standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles.
Can you feel me?
 
Hey, you!
Don't help them to bury the light.
Don't give in without a fight.
 
Hey, you!
Out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone.
Would you touch me?
 
Hey, you!
With your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out.
Would you touch me?
 
Hey, you!
Would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home
 
But it was only fantasy.
The wall was too high as you can see.
No matter how he tried he could not break free.
And the worms ate into his brain.
 
Hey, you!
Out there on the road,
Always doing what you're told.
Can you help me?
 
Hey, you!
Out there beyond the wall,
Breaking bottles in the hall.
Can you help me?
 
Hey, you!
Don't tell me there's no hope at all.
Together we stand,
Divided we fall.
 
"Is There Anybody Out There?"
 
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
 
"Nobody Home"
 
I've got a little black book with my poems in
I've got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
When I'm a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in
 
I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on
Got those swollen hand blues.
I got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V. to choose from
 
I've got electric light
And I've got second sight
Got amazing powers of observation
 
And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
There'll be nobody home
 
I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favourite satin shirt
 
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
I've got a silver spoon on a chain
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
 
I've got wild staring eyes
I've got a strong urge to fly
But I've got nowhere to fly to
 
Ooh, babe, when I pick up the phone
There's still nobody home
 
I've got a pair of Gohills boots
But I've got fading roots.
 
"Comfortably Numb"
 
Hello
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?
 
Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
 
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
 
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
 
I have become comfortably numb
 
O.K.
Just a little pin prick
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
But you may feel a little sick
 
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go
 
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb
 
"The Show Must Go On"
 
Ooh Ma Ooh Pa
Must the show go on?
 
Ooh Pa take me home
Ooh Ma let me go
 
There must be some mistake
I didn't mean to let them take away my soul
Am I too old? Is it too late?
 
Ooh Ma Ooh Pa
Where has the feeling gone?
Ooh Ma Ooh Pa
Will I remember the songs?
Ooh ah the show must go on.
 
"In The Flesh"
 
So ya thought ya might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow
 
I got some bad news for you sunshine
Pink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
We're gonna find out where you fans really stand
 
Are there any queers in the theatre tonight?
Get 'em up against the wall (against the wall)
Now there's one in the spotlight, he don't look right to me
Get him up against the wall (against the...)
 
And that one looks Jewish and that one's a coon
Who let all this riff-raff into the room?
There's one smoking a joint and another with spots
If I had my way I'd have all of ya shot
 
"Run Like Hell"
 
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
 
You better make your face up in
Your favourite disguise
With your button down lips and your
Roller blind eyes
With your empty smile
And your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters
As the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter
Down your door
You better run
 
Run, run, run, run [repeat line four times]
You better run all day
And run all night
And keep your dirty feelings
Deep inside. And if you're
Takin' your girlfriend
Out tonight
You better park the car
Well out of sight
'Cause if they catch you in the back seat
Trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to mother
In a cardboard box
You better run
 
"Waiting For The Worms"
 
Eins, zwei, drei, alle
 
You cannot reach me now
No matter how you try
Goodbye, cruel world, it's over
Walk on by
 
Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come
 
In perfect isolation here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come
 
Waiting to cut out the deadwood
Waiting to clean up the city
Waiting to follow the worms
 
Waiting to put on a black shirt
Waiting to weed out the weaklings
Waiting to smash in their windows and kick in their doors
 
Waiting for the final solution to strengthen the strain
Waiting to follow the worms
 
Waiting to turn on the showers and fire the ovens
Waiting for the queers and the coons and the reds and the Jews
Waiting to follow the worms
 
Would you like to see Britannia rule again,
My friend?
All you have to do is follow the worms
 
Would you like to send our coloured cousins home again,
My friend?
All you need to do is follow the worms.
 
"Stop"
 
Stop
I wanna go home
Take off this uniform
And leave the show
And I'm waiting in this cell
Because I have to know
Have I been guilty all this time

21st Century Schizoid Man
 
Cat's foot iron claw
Neuro-surgeons scream for more
At paranoia's poison door
Twenty first century schizoid man
 
Blood rack barbed wire
Politicians' funeral pyre
Innocents raped with napalm fire
Twenty first century schizoid man
 
Death seed blind man's greed
Poets' starving children bleed
Nothing he's got he really needs
Twenty first century schizoid man
 
Book of Saturday
 
If I only could deceive you
Forgetting the game
Every time I try to leave you
You laugh just the same
'Cause my wheels never touch the road
And the jumble of lies we told
Just returns to my back to weigh me down
We lay cards upon the table
The backs of our hands
And I swear I like your people
The boys in the band
Reminiscences gone astray
Coming back to enjoy the fray
In a tangle of night and daylight sounds
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo
All completeness in the morning
Asleep on your side
I'll be waking up the crewmen
Banana-boat ride
She responds like limousine
Brought alive on the silent screen
To the shuddering breath of yesterday
There's the succor of the needy
Incredible scenes
I'll believe you in the future
Your life and death dreams
As the cavalry of despair
Takes a stand in the lady's hair
For the favor of making sweet sixteen
You make my life and times
A book of bluesy Saturdays
And I have to choose
 
Dinosaur
Long ago and far away in a different age
when I was a dumb young guy
fossilized photos of my life then
illustrate what an easy prey I must have been
standing in the sun, idiot savant
something like a monument
I'm a dinosaur, somebody is digging my bones
 
Ignorance has alway been something I excel in
followed by naivete and pride
doesn't take a scientist to see how
any clever predator could have a piece of me
standing in the sun, idiot savant
something like a monument
I'm a dinosaur, somebody is digging my bones
 
When I look back on the past
it's a wonder I'm not yet extinct
all the mistakes and bad judgements I made
nearly pushed me to the brink
it doesn't pay to be too nice
it's the one thing I have learned
still, I made my fossil bed
now I toss and turn
 
I'm a dinosaur, somebody is digging my bones
 
Epitaph
 
The wall on which the prophets wrote
is cracking at the seams.
Upon the instruments of death
the sunlight brightly gleams.
When every man is torn apart
with nightmares and with dream
will no one lay the laurel wreath
when silence drowns the screams?
 
Confusion will be my epitaph
as I crawl a cracked and broken path.
If we make it, we can all sit back and laugh
but, I fear, tomorrow I'll be crying.
Yes, I fear, tomorrow I'll be crying.
Yes, I fear, tomorrow I'll be crying.
 
Between the iron gates of fate
the seeds of time were sown
and, watered by the deeds of those
who know and who are known,
knowledge is a deadly friend
when no one sets the rules.
The fate of all mankind I see
is in the hands of fools.
 
The wall on which the prophets wrote
is cracking at the seams.
Upon the instruments of death
the sunlight brightly gleams.
When every man is torn apart
with nightmares and with dreams
will no one lay the laurel wreath
when silence drowns the screams?
 
Confusion will be my epitaph
as I crawl a cracked and broken path.
If we make it, we can all sit back and laugh
but, I fear, tomorrow I'll be crying.
Yes, I fear, tomorrow I'll be crying.
Yes, I fear, tomorrow I'll be crying.
 
Crying, crying.
Yes, I fear, tomorrow I'll be crying.
Yes, I fear, tomorrow I'll be crying.
Yes, I fear, tomorrow I'll be crying.
Crying.
 
I Talk to the Wind
 
Said the straight man to the late man
Where have you been
I've been here and I've been there
And I've been in between.
 
I talk to the wind
My words are all carried away
I talk to the wind
The wind does not hear
The wind cannot hear.
 
I'm on the outside looking inside
What do I see
Much confusion
Disillusion
All around me.
 
You don't possess me
Don't impress me
Just upset my mind
Can't instruct me or conduct me
Just use up my time
 
I talk to the wind
My words are all carried away
I talk to the wind
The wind does not hear
The wind cannot hear.
 
In The Wake Of Poseidon
 
Plato's spawn cold ivied eyes
Snare truth in bone and globe.
Harlequins coin pointless games
Sneer jokes in parrot's robe.
Two women weep, Dame Scarlet Screen
Sheds sudden theatre rain,
Whilst dark in dream the Midnight Queen
Knows every human pain.
 
In air, fire, earth and water
World on the scales.
Air, fire, earth and water
Balance of change
World on the scales
On the scales.
 
Bishop's kings spin judgement's blade
Scratch "Faith" on nameless graves.
Harvest hags Hoard ash and sand
Rack rope and chain for slaves
Who fireside fear fermented words
Then rear to spoil the feast
Whilst in the aisle the mad man smiles
To him it matters least.
 
Heroes hands drain stones for blood
To whet the scaling knife.
Magi blind with visions light
Net death in dread of life.
Their children kneel in Jesus till
They learn the price of nail;
Whilst all around our mother earth
Waits balanced on the scales.
 
Moonchild
 
Call her moonchild
Dancing in the shallows of a river
Lonely moonchild
Dreaming in the shadow
of the willow
 
Talking to the trees of the
cobweb strange
Sleeping on the steps of a fountain
Waving silver wands to the
night-birds song
Waiting for the sun on the mountain
 
She's a moonchild
Gathering the flowers in a garden.
Lonely moonchild
Drifting on the echoes of the hours
 
Sailing on the wind
in a milk white gown
Dropping circle stones on a sun dial
Playing hide and seek
with the ghosts of dawn
Waiting for a smile from a sun child
 
 
The Court of the Crimson King
 
The rusted chains of prison moons
Are shattered by the sun.
I walk a road, horizons change
The tournament's begun.
The purple piper plays his tune,
The choirs softly sing;
Three lullabies in an ancient tongue,
For the court of the crimson king.
 
The keeper of the city keys
Put shutters on the dreams.
I wait outside the pilgrim's door
With insufficient schemes.
The black queen chants
the funeral march,
The cracked brass bells will ring;
To summon back the fire witch
To the court of the crimson king.
 
The gardener plants an evergreen
Whilst trampling on a flower.
I chase the wind of a prism ship
To taste the sweet and sour.
The pattern juggler lifts his hand;
The orchestra begin.
As slowly turns the grinding wheel
In the court of the crimson king.
 
On soft gray mornings widows cry
The wise men share a joke;
I run to grasp divining signs
To satisfy the hoax.
The yellow jester does not play
But gently pulls the strings
And smiles as the puppets dance
In the court of the crimson king.
